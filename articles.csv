Design/methodology/approach The paper reports an illustrative case study for MSD Italy, the Italian subsidiary of the USA-based company Merck & Co., Inc. The group sells drugs for human use in Italy but is also active in the veterinary (MSD Animal Health) industry, with Vree Health, and in solutions and software-based services for the healthcare industry. Findings The results show that the adoption of digital technologies could improve the performance of main healthcare business processes, particularly those processes that can be simplified with the adoption of information technology. More specifically, digital technologies could increase efficiency and, at the same time, allow for the delivery of better quality and reduced response times, with many benefits for several stakeholders, such as national health systems, clinicians and patients. Originality/value Although some studies report the need for effective business processes for sustainable healthcare systems, there is a lack of literature regarding the specific implications of the adoption of such digital technologies for the business process management of healthcare firms. This paper attempts to fill in this gap.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1108/BPMJ-04-2017-0084,"",,

These organizations were part of an EMR demonstration project cosponsored by the for-profit segment of the nursing home industry in the region and 1199SEIU United Health Care Workers East, the union that represented frontline staff in these organizations. We report central lessons from our evaluation, which took place over the course of four years and included multiple data sources. The primary purpose of our research was to examine the effects of EMR adoption on employment and labor relations in the participating organizations. Findings are based on a longitudinal study of EMR adoption in 15 of the 20 organizations that received the EMR technology and five “control” organizations, which did not receive the technology, employing a mixed methodological design with both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Results from our research inform the existing EMR adoption discussion in two ways. First, we find mixed evidence associated with EMR implementation. The adoption of this new technology enhances certain organizational outcomes, but it seems to hinder others. Second, findings from our research highlight the importance of preexisting organizational factors as predictors of EMR-associated outcomes. EMR-associated outcomes, positive or negative, are likely to be contingent on key organizational characteristics and on managerial adoption strategies. Our study's findings imply that the meaningful use of EMR needs to take into account not only the technical specifications of EMR but also the organizational characteristics of the physician practices and healthcare facilities adopting the technology. Healthcare organizations vary in their capacity and ability to make optimal use of health information technology, which should be incorporated into public policy and organizational practices designed to increase adoption.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1108/S0742-6186(2012)0000020006,"",,

Design/methodology/approach  – The research is a multiple case design, based on interviews with 15 women with type 1 diabetes who were pregnant, considering pregnancy, or had recently given birth. A thematic analysis, sensitised by activity theory, was used to analyse the data.  Findings  – Health management in this setting involves negotiations and contradictions across boundaries of interacting activities. Participants play an active role in managing their health and using new IT tools in particular ways to support their health management. Using new technologies creates both opportunities and challenges. IT-enabled healthcare devices and other information systems open up new treatment possibilities, but also generate new contradictions between interacting activity systems.  Research limitations/implications  – The research was conducted with a small sample in a specific context of health management. Further research is needed to extend the findings to other contexts.  Practical implications  – Healthcare providers need to accommodate a bottom-up approach to the adoption and use of new technologies in settings where empowered patients play an active role in managing their health.

Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on biopharmaceutical industry literature and data from example clinical studies to describe the issues involved in transitioning to EDC in the clinical trials environment. Findings While electronic data capture systems provide greater efficiencies along the clinical trial supply chain, the industry is still far from achieving wide scale utilization of such technologies. The barriers to successful implementation are multifaceted, involving not only the information technology itself, but also user acceptance issues, lack of interoperability standards, and regulatory compliance. Major shifts in organizational culture and a unified effort within the industry will be necessary in order to derive full benefits from electronic capture systems in the future. Research limitations/implications This study was limited in that case data from only one company was used to supplement the literature review. Further research is warranted to better understand the factors that facilitate adoption of electronic knowledge capture systems in the biopharmaceutical industry. Originality/value While the need for knowledge management in the healthcare industry is indisputable, there has been remarkably slow progress in this area, and a dearth of research exploring implementation issues.

To carry out this study, we conducted in-depth interviews with a matrix of HIT senior managers and thematically analyzed the data. The data was transcribed and uploaded into a Nvivo 11 software for analysis using thematic analysis techniques. Five (5) themes were discovered. They are: 1) Stakeholder participation; 2) Proof of experience in similar project; 3) Availability of committed change agents/all-levels-change representatives; 4) Clearly articulated change implementation strategy; and 5) Training and improvement mechanism (post-implementation).

Design/methodology/approach The approach taken was an investigation based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods for information‐gathering and data‐analysis in the context of diabetes care. A case study approach was adopted with the aim of enhancing general practitioners' (GPs') performance levels through an evaluation monitoring and by controlling care paths dynamics. Findings The realization of the target care path for chronic–degenerative pathologies in the Local Health Trust “Naples 4” in Campania Region (Italy) led to the identification of a suitable framework that modifies, through the implementation of ICT tools, the communications dynamics and the interaction/integration for those actors involved in a patient's care path.

Design/methodology/approach  – Two case studies were conducted with NHS Hospital Trusts, whilst another was built upon secondary resources. Primary findings were triangulated with the information collected from the NHS Trusts’ reports, direct observation and a preliminary round of consultations with 12 health-care professionals working in other NHS Trusts or Integrated Equipment Community Services.  Findings  – The findings of this paper suggest that the sophistication of ICT implementation increases with the risks and value associated with medical devices. Operational attributes are derived from ICT implementations which can positively affect RE performance. The forces that drive the adoption of ICT in the NHS include pressure from government, business partners and patients; competitive pressure; perceived benefits; organisation size; top management support; and the availability of sufficient resources. Obstacles are mainly centred around the lack of sufficient resources.  Research limitations/implications  – Although the trusts that participated in this research are representative of different regions, the generalisation of the study results may be limited by the size of the sample organisations, so the results can only provide insights into the research problem. As this work is exploratory in nature, there is insufficient data on which to form definitive recommendations.  Practical implications  – NHS Trusts may use the six operational attributes identified and verified by the case studies to benchmark their ICT implementation for device management. The actual and potential benefits of ICT implementation could inform technology development and encourage the uptake of ICT in healthcare. Governmental bodies can utilise this information to develop directives to actively drive ICT adoption in device management and the associated RE system. A well-considered training programme is needed to improve staff ICT skills to fully realise the potential of ICT systems which support the effective RE of medical devices.  Originality/value  – The results of this paper suggest that the reverse management of medical devices backs up the supply chain attained through using ICT, which in turn reduces capital costs, medical risk and increases the finance available for frontline medical treatment.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1108/SCM-07-2015-0278,"",,

But the adoption and development of even basic ICT communications services in many health services is limited, leaving enormous gaps in the broad understanding of its role in health care delivery. The purpose of this paper is to address a specific (intercultural) area of healthcare communications consumer disadvantage; and it examines the potential for ICT exploitation through the lens of a conceptual framework. The opportunity to pursue a new solutions pathway has been amplified in recent times through the development of computer-based ontologies and the resultant knowledge from ontologist activity and consequential research publishing.  Design/methodology/approach  – A specific intercultural area of patient disadvantage arises from variations in meaning and understanding of patient and clinician words, phrases and non-verbal expression. Collection and localization of data concepts, their attributes and individual instances were gathered from an Aboriginal trainee nurse focus group and from a qualitative gap analysis (QGA) of 130 criteria-selected sources of literature. These concepts, their relationships and semantic interpretations populate the computer ontology. The ontology mapping involves two domains, namely, Aboriginal English (AE) and Type II diabetes care guidelines. This is preparatory to development of the Patient Practitioner Assistive Communications (PPAC) system for Aboriginal rural and remote patient primary care.  Findings  – The combined QGA and focus group output reported has served to illustrate the call for three important drivers of change. First, there is no evidence to contradict the hypothesis that patient-practitioner interview encounters for many Australian Aboriginal patients and wellbeing outcomes are unsatisfactory at best. Second, there is a potent need for cultural competence knowledge and practice uptake on the part of health care providers; and third, the key contributory component to determine success or failures within healthcare for ethnic minorities is communication. Communication, however, can only be of value in health care if in practice it supports shared cognition; and mutual cognition is rarely achievable when biopsychosocial and other cultural worldview differences go unchallenged.  Research limitations/implications  – There has been no direct engagement with remote Aboriginal communities in this work to date. The authors have initially been able to rely upon a cohort of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people with relevant cultural expertise and extended family relationships. Among these advisers are health care practitioners, academics, trainers, Aboriginal education researchers and workshop attendees. It must therefore be acknowledged that as is the case with the QGA, the majority of the concept data is from third parties. The authors have also discovered that urban influences and cultural sensitivities tend to reduce the extent of, and opportunity to, witness AE usage, thereby limiting the ability to capture more examples of code-switching. Although the PPAC system concept is qualitatively well developed, pending future work planned for rural and remote community engagement the authors presently regard the work as mostly allied to a hypothesis on ontology-driven communications. The concept data population of the AE home talk/health talk ontology has not yet reached a quantitative critical mass to justify application design model engineering and real-world testing.  Originality/value  – Computer ontologies avail us of the opportunity to use assistive communications technology applications as a dynamic support system to elevate the pragmatic experience of health care consultations for both patients and practitioners. The human-machine interactive development and use of such applications is required just to keep pace with increasing demand for healthcare and the growing health knowledge transfer environment. In an age when the worldwide web, communications devices and social media avail us of opportunities to confront the barriers described the authors have begun the first construction of a merged schema for two domains that already have a seemingly intractable negative connection. Through the ontology discipline of building syntactically and semantically robust and accessible concepts; explicit conceptual relationships; and annotative context-oriented guidance; the authors are working towards addressing health literacy and wellbeing outcome deficiencies of benefit to the broader communities of disadvantage patients.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.1108/ITP-08-2014-0166,"",,

Its adoption in the healthcare industry has garnered the attention of healthcare institutions and governments. Given the significant role of subsidies in promoting technology adoption, this study applies evolutionary game theory to examine the impact of government subsidies on the adoption of blockchain technology by healthcare institutions. Design/methodology/approach First, the authors analyze the interests of government administration departments and healthcare institutions separately in regards to blockchain adoption. Subsequently, the authors develop the payoff matrix of both participants and construct the evolutionary game model. And then, the authors calculate the replication dynamic equations and analyze the decision evolution of both participants through the replication dynamic equations and numerical experiments. Findings The numerical experiments demonstrate that government subsidies are effective in encouraging healthcare institutions to adopt blockchain technology. The study also reveals the necessary amount of subsidy required to guide healthcare institutions towards adoption. Additionally, the validity of the evolutionary game model in analyzing the interaction between governments and healthcare institutions is confirmed by the results. Originality/value Blockchain adoption in the healthcare industry differs from other emerging technologies, as there is the potential for it to reduce revenue for healthcare institutions.

The relevant literature still lacks significant studies concerning the issues of the adoption process of health data standards in healthcare organisations, and in particular those in developing nation. In addressing this gap in knowledge, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the adoption decision of health data standards in tertiary healthcare organisations in Saudi Arabia, and to develop a technology-organisation-environment list that contains the critical factors influencing their adoption. Design/methodology/approach A multiple-case study methodology was conducted in Saudi Arabia and different data collection methods were used included semi-structured interviews with different decision makers at various levels and departments of the subject organisations, and documents analysis to identify critical factors to the adoption decision of health data standards. Findings The findings demonstrated a list of key factors from different aspects impacting the adoption decision of health data standards in the subject organisations. The technological factors are complexity and compatibility of health data standards, IT infrastructure, switching costs, market uncertainties, systems integration and enhancing the use of advanced systems. The main organisational factors are the lack of adequate policies and procedures and information management plan, resistance to change, data analysis and accreditation. The core environmental factors are the lack of national regulator and data exchange plan, national healthcare system and the shortage of professionals. Research limitations/implications The results from the qualitative data were difficult to generalise to other populations. For example, the structure of the health sector varies from country to country as each health sector has its own characteristics that affect and are affected by national circumstances. In order to provide a more grounded theory resulting from a qualitative study, further examination by conducting quantitative studies is required. In addition, the TOE approach does not take into account the sociotechnical issues and further research is required in this area. Practical implications The investigation into the adoption decision of health data standards in tertiary healthcare organisations in Saudi Arabia has led to the development of a technology-organisation-environment list that contains the critical factors influencing their adoption. The research outcome has addressed the gap in knowledge of the adoption of health data standards in healthcare organisations. It also provides the decision maker, and in particular those in developing nations, with better understanding of the adoption process of those standards to better judge and to develop suitable strategy of adoption interventions. Originality/value Although recent studies indicated that the level of adoption of health data standards in healthcare organisations remains frustratingly low, the prior studies related to health data standards missed out on the exploration of the adoption decision of different types of health data standards in healthcare organisations and the critical factors influencing their adoption.

This contributes to the body of knowledge and helps hospital managers to understand the relationship and relevance of IoT adoption; otherwise healthcare sector are late movers towards technology adoption. This gives a nuanced framework towards establishing empirically validated framework which will motivate healthcare services providers to be motivated to adopt and implement IoT enabled care delivery. The physician patient interaction and alignment during decision making will foster positive word of mouth, superior care service and reduce extra overheads for healthcare providers without compromise or rather with increment in service delivery proposition. Design/methodology/approach The study theoretically and empirically describes that with the adoption of internet of things (IoT) devices in health care, better services can be provided to patients by using partial least square – structure equation modelling-based robust technique and explains the better understanding of the health-care process with the help of information pervasiveness, physician-patient orientation and improved patient and physician involvement in the decision-making process. Findings This study shows that wearable IoT device adoption in health-care service delivery opens new opportunities and disrupts the conventional and traditional way of health-care service delivery by empowering the patient to take part in decision-making and enhancing their engagement in health-care service delivery. Research limitations/implications The study might influence by generalizability. Perception-based cross-examination knowledge from the patient’s perspective. It is likely that patients who use these devices will grow accustomed to using them and become more capable of using them. Thus, time-series tests have not been used to catch enhanced skills. New patients’ experiences will be altered over time. Regardless, non-response bias and traditional process bias received excessive interest. Practical implications The study aims at unravelling how the adoption of IoT enabled practices and usage of IoT devices bolsters the available data points in the context of healthcare especially with respect to patient care delivery. The study conceptualizes and empirically validates how the usage of IoT interface enabled technology enables better patient treatment and caregiver participation. The study puts forth a nuanced understanding regarding how pervasively available ubiquitous care information fosters shared decision making. This study further emphasizes that importance of ensuring a reliable computing environment devoid of privacy and security risks. The study attempts at Emphasizing empirically how the enhanced information pervasiveness catapults the patient-provider interactions, through health data exchange. Highlighting the importance of search feature in cloud storage and recovery mechanisms. The study not only fulfills the overarching linkage between enhanced service engagement with IoT adoption, it provides a mental map and ready to refer framework for hospital and healthcare experts to refer to, which prescribes thar care providers must build new methods aimed at empowerment of patients to participate and take more inclusive role. This unique confluence between patients and physicians will unravel the sync; helping not only avoid costly decision errors, but also improve patient care delivery environment.

Design/methodology/approach The study relied on 445 healthcare professionals' perspectives to explore different causal pathways to IoTs and BDA adoption and usage for daily healthcare management. The Fussy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis was adopted to explore the underlying pathways for healthcare management. Findings The empirical analysis revealed six different configural paths influencing the acceptance and use of IoTs and BDA for healthcare improvement. Two key user topologies from the six configural paths, digital literacy and ease of use and social influence and behavioural intentions, mostly affect the paths for using digital health technologies by healthcare physicians. Research limitations/implications Despite this study's novel contributions, limitations include the fsQCA methodology, perceptual data and the context of the study. The fsQCA methodology is still evolving with different interpretations, although it reveals new insights and as such further studies are required to explain the configural paths of social phenomena. Additionally, future research should consider other constructs beyond the UTAUT and digital literacy to illustrate configural paths to healthcare technology acceptance and usage. Again, the views of healthcare professionals are perceptual data. Hence future research on operational data will support significant contributions towards pathways to accept and use emerging technologies for healthcare improvement. Lastly, this study is from a developing country perspective where emerging digital healthcare technology is still emerging to support healthcare management. Hence, more investigation from other cross-country analyses of configural paths for digital technology deployment in healthcare will enhance the conversation with IoTs and BDA for healthcare management. Practical implications Holistically, the acceptance and use of healthcare technologies and platforms is not solely on their capabilities, but a combination of distinct factors driven by users' perspectives. This offers healthcare administrators and institutions to essentially reflect on the distinct combinations of conditions favourable to health professionals who can use IoTs and BDA for healthcare improvement. Originality/value This study is among the few scholarly works to empirically investigate the configural paths to support healthcare improvement with emerging technologies. Using fsQCA is a unique contribution to existing information system literature for configural paths for healthcare improvement with emerging digital technologies.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1108/AJIM-10-2022-0465,"",,

In many countries, it is still considered in the early stages with an underestimation of its benefits and potentiality. Especially in Italy, little is known about the impact of digitalization – particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT) – on the healthcare sector, for example, in terms of clinician's jobs and patient's experience. Drawing from such premises, the paper aims to focus on an overlooked healthcare area related to the chronic heart diseases field and its relationship with DT. The authors aim at exploring and framing the main variables of remote Monitoring (RM) adoption as a specific archetype of healthcare digitalization, both on patients and medical staff level, by shedding some lights on its overall implementation. Design/methodology/approach The authors empirically inquiry the RM adoption within the context of the Cardiology Department of the Casilino General Hospital of Rome. To answer our research question, the authors reconstruct the salient information by using induction-type reasoning, direct observation and interviewees with 12 key informants, as well as secondary sources analysis related to the hospital (internal documentation, presentations and technical reports). Findings According to a socio-technical framework, the authors build a model composed of five main variables related to medical staff and patients. The authors classify such variables into an input-process-output (I-P-O) model. RM adoption driver represents the input; cultural digital divide, structure flexibility and reaction to change serve the process and finally, RM outcome stands for the output. All these factors, interacting together, contribute to understanding the RM adoption process for chronic disease management. Research limitations/implications The authors' research presents two main limitations. The first one is related to using a qualitative method, which is less reliable in terms of replication and the interpretive role of researchers. The second limitation, connected to the first one, is related to the study's scale level, which focuses on a mono-centric consistent level of analysis. Practical implications The paper offers a clear understanding of the RM attributes and a comprehensive view for improving the overall quality management of chronic diseases by suggesting that clinicians carefully evaluate both hard and soft variables when undertaking RM adoption decisions. Social implications RM technologies could impact on society both in ordinary situations, by preventing patient mobility issues and transport costs, and in extraordinary times (such as a pandemic), where telemedicine contributes to supporting hospitals in swapping in-person visits with remote controls, in order to minimize the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contagion or the spread of the virus. Originality/value The study enriches the knowledge and understanding of RM adoption within the healthcare sector. From a theoretical perspective, the authors contribute to the healthcare DT adoption debate by focusing on the main variables contributing to the DT process by considering both medical staff and patient's role. From a managerial perspective, the authors highlight the main issues for RM of chronic disease management to enable the transition toward its adoption. Such issues range from the need for awareness of the medical staff about RM advantages to the need for adapting the organizational structure and the training and education process of the patients.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1108/TQM-04-2021-0109,"",,

EMR systems, which have experienced slow adoption rates, promise to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system by facilitating information exchange among physicians caring for the same patients. Design/methodology/approach Survey responses from physicians are used to test several hypotheses. The authors are interested in how market level EMR adoption was related to physician adoption intentions. The authors also test the “strong ties” notion of network effects by examining whether EMR adoption among generalists, and specialist physicians, had differing influences on adoption intentions in a given market. Findings Support for network effects is found; each one unit increase in market‐level EMR adoption is associated with a significant increase in overall physician adoption intention in that market. Secondary analyses suggest adoption of EMRs by specialists is significantly predictive of generalists' adoption intentions in a given market. However, as predicted, EMR among generalists does not influence other generalists' intentions; nor does EMR adoption by a specialists influence other specialists' intentions. Research implications Network effects play a role in the EMR adoption among physicians. Decision‐makers wanting to influence adoption should target defined market segments in an effort to build a critical mass of adoption then move to adjacent segments once network effects take hold.

It seeks to describe RFID's key points, adoptions, risks and benefits, and the areas of its applications. Some applications of RFID in healthcare management are briefly reviewed and three cases are discussed. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides key information on RFID and the integration of healthcare systems and RFID for generating new systems with higher levels of profitability, efficiency, and productivity. Findings To make healthcare systems functional and successfully operational, the healthcare industry can use RFID solutions to reduce operating costs by decreasing the labor costs, insurance claims, the risks associated with medical errors, and errors in medication filling pharmacies. This will help the healthcare industry to increase the operating income by reducing working capital through reductions in inventory level and lowering appropriate costs. Such strategies can bring higher levels of profitability and productivity to the healthcare systems. Practical implications Owing to the fact that a better management of healthcare system is related to the full understanding of RFID technologies and the system under consideration, sufficient background on the RFID technology along with its risks and benefits are provided and its impact on the healthcare management system including profitability and productivity enhancement are discussed.

The research model incorporates two well-known theories namely the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and DeLone and McLean information success model to examine individual behavior towards the adoption of telemedicine application. Design/methodology/approach The research design of this study is based on quantitative research approach. During research survey, 350 valid responses were received from Pakistani citizens and examined to understand citizen's behavior towards the adoption of telemedicine applications. The research model was empirically tested with the latest statistical approach namely variance-based structural equation modeling (VB-SEM). Findings The results of the structural equation modeling have revealed that altogether performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, habit, hedonic motivation, price values, information quality, system quality and service quality explained 77.9% variance in determining user behavior towards adoption of telemedicine application. The predictive relevance of the research model was found substantial in measuring user behavior to adopt telemedicine applications. The research framework is further extended with moderating role of perceived severity between the relationship of user intention and actual usage behavior. Results confirmed that the positive relationship between intention to adopt telemedicine health application and usage behavior will be stronger when perceived severity is higher. Practical implications Theoretically, this study integrates extended UTAUT2 and DeLone and McLean information success model and contributes to e-health literature. Practically, this research suggests that by improving user performance expectancy and effort expectancy, managers and healthcare professionals can boost user confidence towards the adoption of telemedicine applications. Originality/value This study is unique as it integrates the extended UTAUT2 with DeLone and McLean information success model and perceived severity to investigate user behavior towards adoption of telemedicine application during COVID-19 pandemic.

It aims at testing an integrative single model comprising Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), D&M model and e-health system utilization. Design/methodology/approach This study followed the quantitative methodology and the deductive research approach. Data were collected from 241 medical staff who use the system employed in 19 different healthcare centers across the Gaza Strip. Partial least square/structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the collected data and to test study hypotheses. Findings Study concluded that information quality of the adopted Health Information System (HIS) has both direct and indirect positive impact on staff performance, only direct positive impact on patient care and only positive indirect impact on doctor–patient relationship. System quality, on the other hand, was found to have negative direct impact and positive indirect impact on staff performance and has both direct and indirect positive impact on both doctor-patient relationship and patient care. Research limitations/implications Noteworthy that HIS has availability, speed and error detection and error prevention issues. It is recommended that these shortfalls be addressed together with improving user perception towards ease of use and usefulness of the system.

Authors searched Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE (PubMed), 10/02/2012-10/02/2017, core clinical/academic journals, MEDLINE full text, English only, human species and evaluated the articles that were germane to our research objective. Each article was analyzed by multiple reviewers. Group members recognized common facilitators and barriers associated with EHRs effect on population health. A final list of articles was selected by the group after three consensus meetings (n = 55). Among a total of 26 factors identified, 63% (147/232) of those were facilitators and 37% (85/232) barriers. About 70% of the facilitators consisted of productivity/efficiency in EHRs occurring 33 times, increased quality and data management each occurring 19 times, surveillance occurring 17 times, and preventative care occurring 15 times. About 70% of the barriers consisted of missing data occurring 24 times, no standards (interoperability) occurring 13 times, productivity loss occurring 12 times, and technology too complex occurring 10 times. The analysis identified more facilitators than barriers to the use of the EHR to support public health. Wider adoption of the EHR and more comprehensive standards for interoperability will only enhance the ability for the EHR to support this important area of surveillance and disease prevention. This review identifies more facilitators than barriers to using the EHR to support public health, which implies a certain level of usability and acceptance to use the EHR in this manner. The public-health industry should combine their efforts with the interoperability projects to make the EHR both fully adopted and fully interoperable. This will greatly increase the availability, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of data across the country, which will enhance benchmarking and disease surveillance/prevention capabilities.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1007/s10916-018-1075-6,*Electronic Health Records;Humans;Meaningful Use;*Population Health,30269237,PMC6182727

We wanted to assemble an updated and comprehensive list of adoption barriers of EHR systems in the United States. Authors searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, and accepted only articles relevant to our primary objective. Reviewers independently assessed the works highlighted by our search and selected several for review. Through multiple consensus meetings, authors tapered articles to a final selection most germane to the topic (n = 27). Each article was thoroughly examined by multiple authors in order to achieve greater validity. Authors identified 39 barriers to EHR adoption within the literature selected for the review. These barriers appeared 125 times in the literature; the most frequently mentioned barriers were regarding cost, technical concerns, technical support, and resistance to change. Despite federal and local incentives, the initial cost of adopting an EHR is a common existing barrier. The other most commonly mentioned barriers include technical support, technical concerns, and maintenance/ongoing costs. Policy makers should consider incentives that continue to reduce implementation cost, possibly aimed more directly at organizations that are known to have lower adoption rates, such as small hospitals in rural areas.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1007/s10916-016-0628-9,Confidentiality;Costs and Cost Analysis;Electronic Health Records/economics/*statistics & numerical data;Hospital Administration/economics/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Inservice Training;Time Factors;United States;Workflow,27714560,PMC5054043

The US health system has both considerable strengths and notable weaknesses. It has a large and well-trained health workforce, a wide range of high-quality medical specialists as well as secondary and tertiary institutions, a robust health sector research program and, for selected services, among the best medical outcomes in the world. But it also suffers from incomplete coverage of its citizenry, health expenditure levels per person far exceeding all other countries, poor measures on many objective and subjective measures of quality and outcomes, an unequal distribution of resources and outcomes across the country and among different population groups, and lagging efforts to introduce health information technology. It is difficult to determine the extent to which deficiencies are health-system related, though it seems that at least some of the problems are a result of poor access to care. Because of the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the United States is facing a period of enormous potential change. Improving coverage is a central aim, envisaged through subsidies for the uninsured to purchase private insurance, expanded eligibility for Medicaid (in some states) and greater protection for insured persons. Furthermore, primary care and public health receive increased funding, and quality and expenditures are addressed through a range of measures.

Telehealth is used to deliver healthcare services and health-related information by means of information and communication technology (ICT). The systematic review of qualitative studies was conducted using thematic synthesis of previous studies. International electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Eric, Web of Science/Web of Knowledge and Scopus, and Finnish databases Medic and Ohtanen were searched in spring 2013. In addition, the search was complemented in fall 2015. Following critical appraisal, 25 studies from 1998 to fall 2015 were reviewed and the findings were synthesised. Both facilitators and barriers were grouped into five main categories which were related to nurses' skills and attitudes, nurses' work and operations, organisational factors, patients and technology. The highest number of facilitators and barriers was found in the category focusing on nurses' work and operations. Based on the findings, nurses' skills and attitudes are preventing factors in the implementation of telehealth. There is also a need to focus on patients' role in telehealth usage although the findings support positive adoption of ICT tools among patients. The findings call for further development of technological tools used in nursing practice and healthcare services. The change from traditional face-to-face nursing to the use of telehealth calls for local agreements and further discussions among professionals on how this change will be accepted and implemented into practice.

Over half of all patient care is delivered in physician practice organisations, yet adoption and utilisation of HIT in these groups lags behind inpatient facilities. OBJECTIVE: To better understand current utilisation rates along with benefits and barriers to HIT adoption in physician practice organisations. METHODS: Published literature on the adoption and use of HIT in physician practice organisations within the USA between 12 January 2004 and 12 January 2009 and indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE was included in the systematic review. Grey literature was also searched. Studies related to the adoption and use of HIT in hospitals and community health centres were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 119 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Adoption rates across physician groups remain low, with between 9% and 29% of practices having implemented electronic medical records. HIT improves clinical outcomes, increases the use of vaccinations and improves medication adherence. Furthermore, HIT adoption leads to cost savings for physician groups, improves staff productivity and enriches patient-provider interactions. The largest barrier to HIT adoption in physician groups is the high initial and ongoing costs of electronic systems. Lack of sufficient training, a disorganised or non-receptive practice culture and technological problems such as inadequate connectivity appear to impede effective HIT use. CONCLUSIONS: HIT has the potential to positively impact on physician practice organisations, although significant and diverse barriers block adoption.

This research mainly focuses on the HIT efforts in Japan with reference to the US for context. The purpose is to: (a) provide detail on governmental policy impacting promotion of HIT adoption to provide services to the people of Japan, (b) describe the outcomes of past and present policy impacting progress based on a case study of HIT use in the Kyoto Yamashina area, and (c) discuss issues for refinement of current policy. METHODS: The method is case study, and data collection techniques include: (a) interviews of people involved in policy making for HIT in Japan (Japanese healthcare professionals, government officials, and academics involved in HIT research in Japan) and use in the medical community of HIT in the Kyoto Yamashina area, (b) archived document analysis of reports regarding government policy for HIT policy and user assessment for HIT mainly in the case study site, and (c) the literature review about HIT progression and effectiveness assessments to explore and describe issues concerning the transformation with HIT in Japan. RESULTS: This study reveals the aspects of governmental policy that have been effective in promoting successful HIT initiatives as well as some that have been detriments in Japan to help solve pressing social issues regarding healthcare delivery. For example, Japan has stipulated some standardized protocols and formats for HIT but does not mandate exactly how to engage in inter-organizational or intra-organizational health information exchange. This provides some desired autonomy for healthcare organizations and or governments in medical communities and allows for more advanced organizations to leverage current resources while providing a basis for lesser equipped organizations to use in planning the initiative. The insights gained from the Kyoto Yamashina area initiative reflect the success of past governmental policy efforts and the current intent to promote HIT adoption. Insights from the case study as well as other social issues facing Japan warrant some refinement of policy. The refinement concerns: (a) the necessity for leadership and IT knowledge in the medical communities, (b) provider incentives, (c) legislation regarding accountability, security, privacy and confidentiality, (d) inclusion of stakeholders in solution development, and (e) creating sustainable business models.

In the light of an apparent lack of empirically based integrated accounts surrounding these issues, this interpretative review aims to provide an overview and extract potentially generalizable findings across settings. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and critique of the empirical literature published between 1997 and 2010. In doing so, we searched a range of medical databases to identify review papers that related to the implementation and adoption of eHealth applications in organizational settings. We qualitatively synthesized this literature extracting data relating to technologies, contexts, stakeholders, and their inter-relationships. RESULTS: From a total body of 121 systematic reviews, we identified 13 systematic reviews encompassing organizational issues surrounding health information technology implementations. By and large, the evidence indicates that there are a range of technical, social and organizational considerations that need to be deliberated when attempting to ensure that technological innovations are useful for both individuals and organizational processes. However, these dimensions are inter-related, requiring a careful balancing act of strategic implementation decisions in order to ensure that unintended consequences resulting from technology introduction do not pose a threat to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational issues surrounding technology implementations in healthcare settings are crucially important, but have as yet not received adequate research attention. This may in part be due to the subjective nature of factors, but also due to a lack of coordinated efforts toward more theoretically-informed work.

This study is the first to identify characteristics that may drive this variability among health systems. STUDY DESIGN: Responses from the 2017/2018 National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems were used to assess the extent to which healthcare system organizational structure, electronic health record (EHR) standardization, and resource allocation practices were associated with use of 5 advanced HIT capabilities. Of 732 systems surveyed, 446 responded (60.9%), 425 (58.1%) met sample inclusion criteria, and 389 (53.1%) reported consistent EHR use. METHODS: Measures of adoption, resource allocation, and organizational structure were developed based on survey responses. Multivariate linear regression with control variables estimated the relationships. RESULTS: Adoption of advanced HIT capabilities is low and variable, with a mean of 2.4 capabilities adopted and only 8.4% of systems reporting widespread adoption of all 5 capabilities. In adjusted analyses, EHR standardization (β = 0.76; P = .001) was the strongest predictor of the number of advanced capabilities adopted, and ownership and management of medical groups (β = 0.32; P = .04) was also a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Health systems that standardize their EHRs and that own and manage hospitals and medical groups have higher rates of advanced HIT adoption and use.

METHODS: Both survey and various healthcare administrative datasets in Korea were used. The survey was conducted during the period from June 13 to September 25, 2017. The chief information officers of hospitals were respondents. Among them, 257 general hospitals and 273 small hospitals were analyzed. A logistic regression analysis was conducted using the SAS program. RESULTS: The odds of having full EMR systems in general hospitals statistically significantly increased as the number of IT department staff members increased (odds ratio [OR] = 1.058, confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.115; p = 0.038). The odds of having full EMR systems was significantly higher for small hospitals that had an IT department than those of small hospitals with no IT department (OR = 1.325; CI, 1.150-1.525; p < 0.001). Full EMR system adoption had a positive relationship with IT infrastructure in both general hospitals and small hospitals, which was statistically significant in small hospitals.

Prior research on the Electronic Medical Records had largely focused on technical issues but rarely on managerial issues. Such oversight prevented a better understanding of users' resistance to new technologies and the antecedents of technology rejection. Incorporating the enablers and the inhibitors of technology usage intention, this study explores physicians' reactions towards the electronic medical record. The main focus is on the barriers, perceived threat and perceived inequity. 115 physicians from 6 hospitals participated in the questionnaire survey. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to verify the measurement scale and research hypotheses. According to the results, perceived threat shows a direct and negative effect on perceived usefulness and behavioral intentions, as well as an indirect effect on behavioral intentions via perceived usefulness. Perceived inequity reveals a direct and positive effect on perceived threat, and it also shows a direct and negative effect on perceived usefulness. Besides, perceived inequity reveals an indirect effect on behavioral intentions via perceived usefulness with perceived threat as the inhibitor. The research finding presents a better insight into physicians' rejection and the antecedents of such outcome. For the healthcare industry understanding the factors contributing to physicians' technology acceptance is important as to ensure a smooth implementation of any new technology. The results of this study can also provide change managers reference to a smooth IT introduction into an organization.

METHODS: The impact of IT application, domain-specific innovativeness, and technology acceptance model (TAM) variables on future health IT (HIT) utilization intention has been tested through structural equation modeling techniques. The sample consisted of 465 rural health personnel from the Dindigul District of Tamilnadu, India, who had never had access to IT. RESULTS: Data analysis showed that health workers' innovativeness and IT application have a direct and positive influence on future HIT utilization intention and that the basic TAM hypotheses are fulfilled. IT application can be increased with interfaces that are easier to use, but only if perceived usefulness remains high. Health personnel's innovativeness positively influences technology exposure and the ease of use perception of the IT medium, referred to throughout this article as the ""health channel."" CONCLUSIONS: This research enables health departments to know which aspects of their communication strategies to highlight in order to get health personnel and other service providers to adopt IT. Perceived ease of use and IT application has a significant influence on health personnel's willingness to adopt HIT. This shows that health information and adoption by health personnel are key tools in the increase of future HIT. It is also recommended that health directors target some of their health campaigns to the more innovative beneficiaries.

We conducted a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods assessment of the Minnesota HIT survey by assessing level of agreement between it and HIMSS, and a thematic analysis of interview data to assess the respondent's understanding of what was being asked and their approach to responding. RESULTS: We find high agreement between the 2 surveys on questions related to common HIT functionalities-such as computerized provider order entry, medication-based decision support, and e-prescribing-which were widely adopted by respondents' organizations. Qualitative data suggest respondents found wording of items about these functionalities clear but encountered multiple challenges including interpreting items for less commonly adopted functionalities, estimating degree of HIT usage, and indicating relevant barriers.

We also discuss the opportunities for better integrating HFE methods within biomedical informatics research and its potential advantages. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HFE methods is still in its infancy - better integration of HFE within the design lifecycle, and quality improvement efforts can further the ability of informatics researchers to address the key concerns regarding the complexity in clinical settings and develop HIT solutions that are designed within the social fabric of the considered setting.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.15265/IY-2014-0005,"Diffusion of Innovation;*Ergonomics;Humans;*Medical Informatics/trends;Medical Records Systems, Computerized;*Patient Safety",25123724,PMC4287067

We sought to update a previous description of the size, growth, and characteristics of this workforce based on the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics(®) Database, a resource that includes hospital size, number of beds, amount of staffing, and an eight-stage model of electronic health record adoption (Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model, EMRAM℠). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We updated an analysis done using a 2007 snapshot of the HIMSS Analytics Database with a comparable snapshot from 2014 in order to estimate the size of the current workforce and project future needs. For the 2014 data, we applied the same weighted average analysis used in 2007 to obtain a ratio of information technology (IT) hospital full-time equivalent (FTE) to staffed beds, extrapolate the results to all US hospitals, and project the workforce needs as hospitals achieve higher EMRAM stages. RESULTS: Our estimated size of the healthcare information technology workforce in the US in 2014 was 161 160, which was 8.0% larger than the estimate based on the 2007 data. Based on the new data, we project a potential need for an additional 19 852 and 153 114 FTE, if all hospitals were to achieve EMRAM Stages 6 and 7, respectively. The distribution of FTE across job function category varies by EMRAM stage.

These approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Individuals' acceptance and subsequent usage of a new IT is predicated on both. Additionally, the tendency in past studies has been to examine either the rational or the poignant factors in the context of a ""resource-rich"" environment-one in which there is an abundance of IT, adequate infrastructure, and a high level of acculturation to technology solutions. Consequently, there is a clear need for the examination of these factors in resource-poor environments, where assumptions on technology abundance and technology culturation do not hold. We empirically test a model that explains the intention of physicians in a resource-poor environment (epitomized by rural Ethiopia) to adopt telemedicine systems. This model integrates the rational factors driving goal-oriented behavior with the poignant/emotive factors that are an innate part of each adopter's reaction to the new technology. We use the model to expose salient contextual factors that explain the acceptance behavior of individuals toward complex information and communications technology (ICT) solutions and implications of these on the management of technology transfer initiatives in a resource-poor environment. The model is parsimonious, yet explains 28% of the variance in the intention to adopt telemedicine systems and 58% in perceived ease of use. The theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed. Namely, Sub-Saharan African, in general, and Ethiopian culture, in particular, plays an integral role in the adoption of ICT solutions. Organizational positions and roles among physicians, clinical professionals, and superiors stand to impact the adoption of telemedicine and other healthcare applications.

METHODS: We segmented HIT into eight major stakeholder groups and identified major functionalities that should ideally exist for each, focusing on applications most likely to improve patient safety, quality of care and organizational efficiency. We then conducted a multi-site qualitative study in Boston and Denver by interviewing key informants from each stakeholder group. Interview transcripts were analyzed to assess the level of adoption and to document the major barriers to further adoption. Findings for Boston and Denver were then presented to an expert panel, which was then asked to estimate the national level of adoption using the modified Delphi approach. We measured adoption level in Boston and Denver was graded on Rogers' technology adoption curve by co-investigators. National estimates from our expert panel were expressed as percentages. RESULTS: Adoption of functionalities with financial benefits far exceeds adoption of those with safety and quality benefits. Despite growing interest to adopt HIT to improve safety and quality, adoption remains limited, especially in the area of ambulatory electronic health records and physician-patient communication. Organizations, particularly physicians' practices, face enormous financial challenges in adopting HIT, and concerns remain about its impact on productivity.

Studying racial-ethnic disparities in HIT engagement will help understand and overcome challenges to healthcare utilization. METHODS: We undertook a patient-reported survey among patients with lymphoid malignancies at two campuses of Mayo Clinic, Florida to explore HIT-related disparities. Variables between Whites and non-Whites, and non-Whites from the two campuses were compared. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1004 respondents, with 71% whites, 27% non-Whites (race-ethnicity not reported by 2%). Non-Whites included 30% responders at the main campus and 64% at an inner-city campus. Whites were significantly older and had higher education, while non-Whites had lesser access to a computer. Only 51% of non-Whites were registered to use electronic medical records (EMR) as compared to 72% Whites (p < 0.001) and significantly lesser number of non-Whites even knew that EMR existed (81% vs. 92%, p < 0.001). Encouragingly, a higher number of non-Whites wanted to engage in EMR. Non-Whites from the main campus were older, more educated and had more access to a computer as compared to those from the inner-city campus. Similar disparate factors were noted among minorities from the two campuses, suggesting impact of socioeconomic backgrounds on EMR usage among non-Whites. Linguistic barriers were more striking among inner-city campus non-Whites.

This study examines how hospitals' organisational and geographical characteristics influence the adoption of HIT in Mongolian tertiary and secondary care hospitals. METHODS: А cross-sectional study involving the executive directors and medical equipment engineers was conducted in 39 hospitals. Data acquired from questionnaires are (1) hospitals' organisational and geographical characteristics, including bed-size capacity, ownership type, status, and location of the hospitals, and (2) the adoption rate of HIT, and its categories are based on the Health Information and Management Systems Society's classification (2002). The dependent variable was measured as numbers and the rate of HIT programs adopted clinical, administrative, and strategic information technologies (IT). A regression analysis was used to estimate the factors of impact on the adoption of clinical, administrative, and strategic IT. RESULTS: We found a concerning relationship between the characteristics and adoption of HITs. On average, the number of HIT programs adopted was 18, covering nine clinical IT programs, six administrative IT programs, and three strategic IT programs. The adoption rate of overall HIT was 33.29% in the hospitals. In regression analysis, the organisational and geographical characteristics' impact and HIT adoption of hospitals was positively associated with large bed-size (clinical IT: β = 0.256, P < 0.001; administrative IT: β = 0.3654, P < 0.001; strategic IT: β = 0.0006, P < 0.001), for-profit (strategic IT: β = 0.1995, P < 0.01), teaching (clinical IT: β = 0.2560, P < 0.05; administrative IT: β = 0.1985, P < 0.05; strategic IT: β = 0.2236, P < 0.01), and urban location (clinical IT: β = 0.2840, P < 0.001, administrative IT: β = 0.2256, P < 0.01; strategic IT: β = 0.2256, P < 0.001).

Hence, the government of Hong Kong has recently taken several community and information technology (IT) services initiatives to train older adults on how to enhance their abilities and interest in using mHealth technology. Although mHealth services have been widely implemented globally, their adoption and use by older adults are very low, including those in Hong Kong. This study aims to understand key factors influencing mHealth use intention among the older Chinese population in Hong Kong. METHODS: We extended the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) as the basis of our conceptual framework. We applied Partial Least Squares path modeling method to conduct the Structural Equation Model (SEM) technique that allows measuring the theoretical validity of any conceptual framework. Convenience and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit participants aged 65 or above. In total, 201 valid responses were used for testing the theoretical validity of the proposed conceptual framework. RESULTS: The primary finding shows that the widely used UTAUT2 model falls short in explaining mHealth service acceptance behavior in the Chinese older population in Hong Kong. We further propose a simplified model, the Healthcare Technology Service Acceptance (HTSA) model, to understand the formation of mHealth service acceptance behavior. The findings show that trust is an important component of technology service acceptance intention behavior that was missing in the UTAUT2 model. The results also show that several antecedent factors (i.e., social influence, government policy, and service quality) are critical in forming technology trust beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the HTSA model can better explain mHealth acceptance behavior than the UTAUT2 model. This study advances knowledge in the mHealth technology adoption domain by proposing a simplified new version of the UTAUT2 model for understanding healthcare technology service acceptance and use intention among older adults.

RESULTS: The results demonstrate important associations between the attributes of clinical leaders and IT adoption. Clinical leaders who have technical informatics skills and prior experience with IT project management are likely to develop a vision that comprises a long-term commitment to the use of IT. Leaders who possess such a vision believe in the value of IT, are motivated to adopt it, and can maintain confidence and stability through the adversities that IT adoptions often entail. This leads to proactive leadership behaviours and partnerships with IT professionals that are associated with successful organisational and clinical outcomes.

In many environments, this has led to the ability to achieve new efficiencies and levels of safety. In others, the impact has been less positive, and is associated with both: 1) workflow and user experience dissatisfaction; and 2) perceptions of missed opportunities relative to the use of computational tools to enable data-driven and precise clinical decision making. Simultaneously, the ""pipeline"" through which new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents are being developed and brought to the point-of-care or population health is challenged in terms of both cost and timeliness. Given the confluence of these trends, it can be argued that now is the time to consider new ways in which HIT can be used to deliver health and wellness interventions comparable to traditional approaches (e.g., drugs, devices, diagnostics, and behavioral modifications). Doing so could serve to fulfill the promise of what has been recently promoted as ""precision medicine"" in a rapid and cost-effective manner. However, it will also require the health and life sciences community to embrace new modes of using HIT, wherein the use of technology becomes a primary intervention as opposed to enabler of more conventional approaches, a model that we refer to in this commentary as ""interventional informatics"". Such a paradigm requires attention to critical issues, including: 1) the nature of the relationships between HIT vendors and healthcare innovators; 2) the formation and function of multidisciplinary teams consisting of technologists, informaticians, and clinical or scientific subject matter experts; and 3) the optimal design and execution of clinical studies that focus on HIT as the intervention of interest. Ultimately, the goal of an ""interventional informatics"" approach can and should be to substantially improve human health and wellness through the use of data-driven interventions at the point of care of broader population levels.

Factors associated with adoption and implementation were modeled using random-intercept logistic regression. RESULTS: Consistent with a perspective that adoption and implementation are different phenomena, many factors associated with an increased odds of adoption, were unassociated with implementation and vice versa. Non-profit status, public hospitals, more live and operation applications, more emergency room visits, network membership, and the presence of physician portals all increased hospitals' odds of HIE adoption. However, only network membership increased the odds of HIE implementation, whereas competition decreased those odds significantly.

Studies have demonstrated that promising outcomes of health IT initiatives can be obtained when patients and family members participate and engage in the adoption, use, and evaluation of these technologies. Despite knowing this, there is a lack of health care organizations using patient and family engagement strategies to enhance the use and adoption of health ITs, specifically. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to answer the following three research questions (RQs): (1) what current frameworks or theories have been used to guide patient and family engagement in health IT adoption, use, implementation, selection, and evaluation?, (2) what studies have been done on patient and family engagement strategies in health IT adoption, use, implementation, selection, and evaluation?, and (3) what patient and family engagement frameworks, studies, or resources identified in the literature can be applied to health IT adoption, use, implementation, selection, and evaluation? METHODS: This scoping review used a five-step framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and adapted by Levac et al. These steps include the following: (1) identifying the RQ, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting studies, (4) charting relevant data, and (5) summarizing and reporting the result. Retrieved academic and grey literature records were evaluated using a literature review software based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. If consensus was not achieved, two reviewers would resolve conflicts by discussion. Research findings and strategies were extracted from the studies and summarized in data tables. RESULTS: A total of 35 academic articles and 23 gray literature documents met the inclusion criteria. In total, 20 of the 35 included studies have been published since 2017. Frameworks found include the patient engagement framework developed by Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and the patient and family engagement framework proposed by Carman et al. Effective strategies include providing patients with clear expectations and responsibilities and providing reimbursement for time and travel. The gray literature sources outlined key considerations for planning and supporting engagement initiatives such as providing patients with professional development opportunities, and embedding patients in existing governance structures. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies have reported their findings regarding successful strategies to engage patients and family members in health IT initiatives and the positive impact that can emerge when patients and family members are engaged in such initiatives in an effective manner. Currently, no framework has consolidated all of the key strategies and considerations that were found in this review to guide health care organizations when engaging patients and family members in a health IT-specific project or initiative.

A Systematic Review (SR) was conducted between December 2017 and February 2018 (with a search update in 2018-2019) to critically appraise and synthesise existing evidence on HIT adoption factors among seniors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, five major databases were consulted (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science). The inclusion criteria consisted of empirical studies, published in English, and reporting impacts of specific factors on HIT adoption among seniors in the community. A total of 41 studies were included in this review, mostly published between 2014 and 2017 in Europe and the US; the level of evidence in these studies was low to moderate. The factors that affect HIT adoption did not differ across types of technologies or age groups. The findings reveal that seniors adopt HIT that are perceived as useful and requiring low effort commitment; price/cost value were reported as adoption barriers. Social influence, facilitating conditions, senior-friendly product design, self-efficacy, Intrinsic Technology Quality, experience/training and technology anxiety may affect HIT adoption by seniors, although the evidence on these impacts remains weak and limited. Mixed and inconclusive evidence was observed on the impacts of socio-demographic variables, health condition, habit and privacy/security.

Our goal was to systematically assess the impact of these initiatives by quantifying the level of adoption and key factors associated with adoption among community health centers in California. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional statewide survey. METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey of all California primary care community health centers (CHCs) from August to September 2013. Multiple logistic regressions were fit to test for associations between various practice characteristics and adoption of EHRs, meaningful use-certified EHRs, and HIE. For the multivariable model, we included those variables which were significant at the P = .10 level in the univariate tests. RESULTS: We received responses from 194 CHCs (73.5% response rate). Adoption of any EHRs (80.3%) and meaningful use-certified EHRs (94.6% of those with an EHR) was very high. Adoption of HIE is substantial (48.7%) and took place within a few years (mean = 2.61 years; SD = 2.01). More than half (54.7%) of CHCs are able to receive data into the EHR indicating some level of interoperability. Patient engagement capacity is moderate, with 21.6% offering a PHR, and 55.2% electronic visit summaries. Rural location and belonging to a multi-site clinic organization both increase the odds of adoption of EHRs, HIE, and electronic visit summary, with the odds ratio ranging from 0.63 to 3.28 (all P values < .05).

AIM: The purpose of this study was identifying the perception of patients from the application of information communication technology in self-care in educational centers of Urmia University of Medical Sciences. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in 2018. The studied population consisted 540 hospitalized patients from educational hospitals affiliated to Urmia university of medical sciences. For data collection, a self-designed questionnaire was developed which valid and reliable instrument to be measured. The statistical analysis of data was done using the SPSS Software.

Furthermore, there is a need to move away from the reactive, doctor-centred model of care to one that is more patient-centred and that consistently delivers accessible, high-quality and safe care to all. Greater use of health information technology (HIT) is seen by many key decision makers as crucial to this transformation process and, hence, substantial investments are made in this area. However, healthcare, particularly in UK hospitals, remains a laggard in HIT adoption. To uncover the underlying reasons, we discuss current implementation and adoption challenges and explore potential ways to address these. We outline strategic, organisational, technical and social factors that can 'make or break' technological implementations. Most importantly, we suggest that efforts should be characterised by an underlying awareness of the complexity of the hospital environment and the need to develop tools that support provision of integrated multidisciplinary care. We conclude with a discussion of promising future developments, including increased patient involvement; access and contribution to shared records; the penetration of smart devices; greater health information exchange and interoperability; and innovative real-time secondary uses of data. We argue that there is considerable merit in evaluating the introduction of these interventions to help ensure that they are optimised for effectiveness, support efficient working and minimise the possibility of inadvertently introducing new risks into already complex health systems. Our over-riding message is that HIT should be seen as, where appropriate, a potential enabler and an important source of data to support healthcare redesign and that critical, ongoing evaluation is key to maximising benefits.

Hospital adoption of electronic health records with Meaningful Use (MU) capabilities expected to improve medication safety has grown rapidly. However, evidence that MU capabilities are associated with declines in in-hospital ADEs is lacking. METHODS: Data came from the 2010-2013 Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System and the 2008-2013 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics Database. Two-level random intercept logistic regression was used to estimate the association of MU capabilities and occurrence of ADEs, adjusting for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, and year of observation. RESULTS: Rates of in-hospital ADEs declined by 19% from 2010 to 2013. Adoption of MU capabilities was associated with 11% lower odds of an ADE (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.96). Interoperability capability was associated with 19% lower odds of an ADE (95% CI, 0.67- 0.98). Adoption of MU capabilities explained 22% of the observed reduction in ADEs, or 67,000 fewer ADEs averted by MU. DISCUSSION: Concurrent with the rapid uptake of MU and interoperability, occurrence of in-hospital ADEs declined significantly from 2010 to 2013. MU capabilities and interoperability were associated with lower occurrence of ADEs, but the effects did not vary by experience with MU. About one-fifth of the decline in ADEs from 2010 to 2013 was attributable to MU capabilities.

Their adoption provides clinicians with a central location to access and share data, write notes, order labs and prescriptions, and bill for patient visits. However, as non-clinical requirements have increased, time spent using EHRs eclipsed time spent on direct patient care. Several solutions have been proposed to minimize the time spent using EHRs, though each have limitations. Digital scribe technology uses voice-to-text software to convert ambient listening to meaningful medical notes and may eliminate the physical task of documentation, allowing physicians to spend less time on EHR engagement and more time with patients. However, adoption of digital scribe technology poses many barriers for physicians. In this study, we perform a scoping review of the literature to identify barriers to digital scribe implementation and provide solutions to address these barriers. We performed a literature review of digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion and information extraction as a scope for future research. Fifteen articles met inclusion criteria. Of the articles included, four were comparative studies, three were reviews, three were original investigations, two were perspective pieces, one was a cost-effectiveness study, one was a keynote address, and one was an observational study. The published articles on digital scribe technology and voice-to-text conversion highlight digital scribe technology as a solution to the inefficient interaction with EHRs. Benefits of digital scribe technologies included enhancing clinician ability to navigate charts, write notes, use decision support tools, and improve the quality of time spent with patients. Digital scribe technologies can improve clinic efficiency and increase patient access to care while simultaneously reducing physician burnout. Implementation barriers include upfront costs, integration with existing technology, and time-intensive training. Technological barriers include adaptability to linguistic differences, compatibility across different clinical encounters, and integration of medical jargon into the note. Broader risks include automation bias and risks to data privacy. Overcoming significant barriers to implementation will facilitate more widespread adoption.

The strategies adopted by various AHRQ grantees and the lessons learned from their projects should become part of the toolset for current and future implementers of health IT as the nation moves rapidly towards its widespread adoption.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.1197/jamia.M3033,*Health Plan Implementation;Health Planning Technical Assistance;Humans;Information Systems/*organization & administration;Program Evaluation/*methods;United States;United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,19567800,PMC2744713

The inconsistent findings point to the need for a conceptual model that will guide research in sorting out the complex relationships between health IT and the quality and safety of care. METHODS: A conceptual model was developed that describes how specific health IT functions could affect different types of inpatient safety errors and that include contextual factors that influence successful health IT implementation. The model was applied to a readily available patient safety measure and nationwide data (2009 AHA Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement and 2009 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases). FINDINGS: The model was difficult to operationalize because (1) available health IT adoption data did not characterize health IT features and extent of usage, and (2) patient safety measures did not elucidate the process failures leading to safety-related outcomes. The sample patient safety measure--Postoperative Physiologic and Metabolic Derangement Rate--was not significantly related to self-reported health IT capabilities when adjusted for hospital structural characteristics. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate the critical need for collecting data that are germane to health IT and the possible mechanisms by which health IT may affect inpatient safety. Well-defined and sufficiently granular measures of provider's correct use of health IT functions, the contextual factors surrounding health IT use, and patient safety errors leading to health care-associated conditions are needed to illuminate the impact of health IT on patient safety.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1016/s1553-7250(13)39055-2,Communication;Data Collection/methods;*Hospital Administration;Humans;Information Systems/*organization & administration/standards;Medical Errors/prevention & control;Patient Care Management/organization & administration;*Patient Safety;Safety Management/*organization & administration/standards,24147353,

Nursing homes are not eligible for incentives. However, understanding health information technology (HIT) adoption among nursing homes will be critical to developing HIT policies for this sector. Our objective was to assess the pace of EHR adoption, changes in computerized function adoption, and participation in health information exchange by New York state nursing homes over time. STUDY DESIGN: We used a repeated, cross-sectional study design. METHODS: We surveyed all New York state nursing homes between February and May 2013, comparing results to the same survey administered in 2012. RESULTS: We received responses from 472 of 630 nursing homes (74.9%). Rates of EHR adoption increased from 48.6% to 56.3% (P = .03). Participation in health information exchange remained unchanged (54.5% to 55.3%, P = .8). The top barriers to EHR adoption cited were: a) the initial cost of HIT investment (67.9%, n = 133), b) lack of technical IT staff (46.4%, n = 91), and c) lack of fiscal incentives (45.8%, n = 88). Comparing nursing homes with EHRs in 2012 to nursing homes with EHRs in 2013, the availability of many types of computerized functionalities significantly increased, although no gains were seen for order entry or clinical tools. CONCLUSIONS: While some gains are being made by nursing homes, HIT adoption generally lags behind that of other sectors. Public policy focusing on building HIT infrastructure is essential to ensure that nursing homes keep up with other healthcare segments.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,,Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;Health Information Exchange/statistics & numerical data;Homes for the Aged/*statistics & numerical data;Humans;Medical Informatics/statistics & numerical data;New York;Nursing Homes/*statistics & numerical data;Ownership,25811820,

Successful adoption and sustainable integration of information technology-based eHealth and telemedicine concepts in clinical practice depend on constant evaluation of end user needs, proficiencies, and preferences. We therefore assessed how current and future healthcare professionals perceived health technology solutions and whether their perceptions differed. We conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of employees and students at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. The structured questionnaire collected self-reported practices and beliefs in the context of eHealth and telemedicine among 905 participants (59.0% females), of which 48.4% were employees and 51.6% were students. Participants expressed moderate knowledge of eHealth and telemedicine concepts with higher levels among employees compared to students (both: p<0.05). Compared to employees, students were less convinced that online health information improves patient knowledge (p<0.001), but were more optimistic that telemedicine reduces healthcare costs (p<0.05). Participants doubted that telemedicine services would enhance the doctor-patient relationship and raised concerns regarding data security and privacy issues. Accordingly, quantitative context analysis of free text comments revealed that the four most frequently mentioned themes were related to issues concerning data privacy and security, questions of responsibility, doctor-patient interaction, and reliability of information. This study provides valuable insights into how current and future healthcare professionals differ in their perceptions regarding eHealth and telemedicine.

As the NODE network reviewed the state of the field, it was noted that despite substantial financial and human capital investments, the processes and results of HIT innovation seem chaotic and subpar, especially in comparison to the more well-established drug and device industries. During the course of this white paper, we will explore the causes for this observed phenomenon as well as propose possible solutions to improve the state of HIT. METHODS: We compared the entire process of discovery, proof of concept, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review, and postmarket monitoring and distribution/implementation of HIT innovations to the equivalent processes for drugs and devices. Whereas drug and device innovations are subject to a standardized pipeline of production, HIT innovations are not held to equivalent standards. CONCLUSIONS: As a result, HIT lags behind the more mature drug and device industries in producing effective and reliable products. This leads to an inefficient use of already scarce healthcare resources. The authors believe that the HIT industry must adopt many of the mechanisms implemented by the drug and device industries as dictated by their innovation pipelines of discovery, proof of concept, FDA review, and postmarket monitoring and distribution/implementation. We propose an eight-point plan to fundamentally evolve the HIT lifecycle, including reforms for institutions such as neutral government agencies, new health system boards and management systems, modified incentive structures, improved relationships with financial investors and start-ups, patient engagement, and enhanced mechanisms to improve HIT adoption.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1159/000479017,"",32095746,PMC7015377

HIT was compared globally by using data from the Ministry of the Interior, Republic of China (Taiwan). Taiwan has been providing universal healthcare since 1995 and began to strategically implement HIT on a national level at that time. Today the national-level HIT system is more extensive in Taiwan than in many other countries and is used to aid administration, clinical care, and public health. The experience of Taiwan thus can provide an illustration of how HIT can be used to support universal healthcare delivery. In this article we present an overview of some key historical developments and successes in the adoption of HIT in Taiwan over a 17-year period, as well as some more recent developments.

METHODS: To examine the effect of health IT on CMI, a generalized estimation equation (GEE) was applied to two years of California hospital data. RESULTS: We found that IT was positively associated with CMI, indicating that increased IT adoption could lead to a higher CMI or billing though DRG up-coding. This implies that hospitals' revenue could increase around $40,000 by increasing IT investment by 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The positive association between IT and CMI implies that IT adoption itself could lead to higher patient billings. Generally, a higher CMI in a hospital indicates that the hospital provides expensive services with higher coding and therefore receives more money from patients.

Few people understand that besides being places of confinement, jails function as health care providers. The separation of jails from community results in disjointed health care services and treatment for individuals cycling in and out of jail. Healthcare providers in the community have little knowledge of the care their patients have received in jail; the same can be said of jail health providers about care provided in the community. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), the federal government took the lead respectively in expanding health insurance coverage and in spurring the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the development of health information exchanges (HIEs). Taken together, these initiatives place a strong emphasis on promoting continuity of care. With the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, many of the individuals leaving jail will have access to health insurance for the first time. Community-based providers to the newly insured will want to know about the care that was provided in the jail. The developing technological infrastructure would seem to offer the best way to access this information. However linking the community and jail information systems is not just a technological issue, but requires the cooperation of all stakeholders. THIS PAPER PRESENTS TWO CASE STUDIES: one in which a single champion made the decision to link the jail health care system to the local HIE and the other where all stakeholders were included in the process. In the first case study, the jail healthcare system reverted to its ""island"" status when the HIE was abandoned without protest from community stakeholders. In the second case study, the multiple stakeholder approach, while not necessarily a complete guarantee of long-term success, ensured that the jail healthcare system could not so easily go back to being an island cut off from the rest of the community.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,,Communication;Continuity of Patient Care/organization & administration;Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration;*Health Information Exchange;Humans;*Interinstitutional Relations;Internet;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;Prisons/*organization & administration;*Residence Characteristics;United States,24808809,PMC3995481

However, the link between HIT and physician career satisfaction, which could potentially reduce provider burnout and attrition, has not been fully examined. This study uses a nationally representative survey to assess the association between key forms of HIT and career satisfaction among primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialty physicians. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of physician career satisfaction using the Community Tracking Study Physician Survey, 2004-2005. Nine specific types of HIT as well as the overall adoption of HIT in the practice were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Physicians who used five to six (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46) or seven to nine (OR = 1.47) types of HIT were more likely than physicians who used zero to two types of HIT to be ""very satisfied"" with their careers. Information technology usages for communicating with other physicians (OR = 1.31) and e-mailing patients (OR = 1.35) were positively associated with career satisfaction. PCPs who used technology to write prescriptions were less likely to report career satisfaction (OR = 0.67), while specialists who wrote notes using technology were less likely to report career satisfaction (OR = 0.75).

PURPOSES: : Rooted in resource dependence theory and the information uncertainty perspective, this study examined the relationship between environmental market characteristics and hospitals' selection of a health information technology (HIT) management strategy. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: : A cross-sectional design is used to analyze secondary data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics Database, and the Area Resource File. Univariate and multinomial logistic regression analyses are used. FINDINGS: : Overall, 3,221 hospitals were studied, of which 60.9% pursed a single-vendor HIT management strategy, 28.9% pursued a best-of-suite strategy, and 10.2% used a best-of-breed strategy. Multivariate analyses controlling for hospital characteristics found that measures of environmental factors representing munificence, dynamism, and/or complexity were systematically associated with various hospital HIT management strategy use. Specifically, the number of generalist physicians per capita was positively associated with the single-vendor strategy (B = -5.64, p = .10). Hospitals in urban markets were more likely to pursue the best-of-suite strategy (B = 0.622, p < .001). Dynamism, measured as the number of managed care contracts for a given hospital, was negatively associated with the single-vendor strategy (B = 0.004, p = .049). Lastly, complexity, measured as market competition, was positively associated with the best-of-breed strategy (B = 0.623, p = .042).

Efficacious utilization of HealthIT requires eHealth literacy. Although eHealth literacy is comprised of six factors, new research indicates that the components related to technology literacy may be more impactful in eHealth literacy among certain populations (e.g., older populations who shoulder a greater illness-management burden). Recognizing the importance of technology literacy in eHealth literacy across the lifespan, we investigate generational differences in New Communication Technology (NCT) use and eHealth literacy, especially considering how NCT adoption theory might systematically inform scholars' understanding of eHealth literacy. Participants included 525 adults primarily in the Midwestern United States. We found significant differences between generational groups across all variables. We found that UTAUT determinants such as performance expectancy and effort expectancy explained 38% of the variance in eHealth literacy, controlling for age, sex, level of education, and prior online health information seeking. Finally, we engaged with early critiques of UTAUT, finding that when applying UTAUT in voluntary (vs. mandatory) contexts, scholars should reconsider variables previously dismissed, such as attitude.

Many hospitals have already implemented HIT, and federal stimulus funding will further adoption efforts. Organizations become more similar through the adoption of innovations like HIT, but the effects of the changes do not necessarily improve efficiency. This view from sociology and organizational studies, called institutional isomorphism, suggests that organizations pursue changes endorsed by peers, regulators, and professional societies through mimetic, coercive, and normative mechanisms, respectively, that improve legitimacy, a socially constructed value that determines an organization's ability to obtain resources and survive. In this paper we examine mimetic, coercive, and normative influences in the adoption of three HIT innovations as well as evidence of resulting inefficiency.

Data were analyzed descriptively and via generalized linear models. (3) Results: 185 pwMS, 25 informal caregivers, and 24 HCPs in the field of MS participated. Nine out of ten pwMS used information technology on a daily base. Individual impairments like in vision and cognition resulted in individual needs like the desire to actively monitor their disease course or communicate with their physician in person. HCPs reported that a complete medication overview, additional medication information, overview of future visits and a reminder of medication intake would be very helpful eHealth features for pwMS, while they themselves preferred features organizing and enriching future visits. (4) Conclusions: A closer look at the various profiles of eHealth adoption in pwMS and their caregivers indicated that there is a broad and robust enthusiasm across several subgroups that does not exclude anyone in general, but constitutes specific areas of interest.

METHODS: Guided by the grounded theory methodology, a PROM healthcare system implementation framework was developed following multiple steps. Based on interviews with 28 experts from 12 countries and a literature review, a framework was drafted and refined through 29 additional validation interviews. RESULTS: The resulting framework comprises 5 implementation stages along 7 dimensions. Implementation stages range from ""first experimentation"" to ""system-wide adoption and a vibrant ecosystem.""

DATA AND METHODS: The solution proposed is based on comparing the predictive capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The latter integrates artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic and can handle certain complex problems that include fuzziness in human perception, and non-normal and non-linear data. Secondary data from two surveys were combined to develop the model. Hospital HIT adoption capability and use indicators in the Canadian province of Ontario were used as inputs, while patient satisfaction indicators of healthcare services in acute hospitals were used as outputs. RESULTS: Eight different types of models were trained and tested for each of four patient satisfaction dimensions. The accuracy of each predictive model was evaluated through statistical performance measures, including root mean square error (RMSE), and adjusted coefficient of determination R(2)(Adjusted). For all four patient satisfaction indicators, the performance of ANFIS was found to be more effective (R(Adjusted)(2)=0.99) when compared with the results of ANN modeling in predicting the impact of HIT adoption on patient satisfaction (R(Adjusted)(2)=0.86-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of HIT adoption on patient satisfaction was obtained for different HIT adoption scenarios using ANFIS simulations. The results through simulation scenarios revealed that full implementation of HIT in hospitals can lead to significant improvement in patient satisfaction.

E-health refers to internet-based health care and information delivery and seeks to improve health service locally, regionally and worldwide. E-sexual health presents new opportunities to provide online sexual health services irrespective of gender, age, sexual orientation and location. DISCUSSION: The paper used the dimensions of the RE-AIM model (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance) as a guiding principle to discuss potentials of E-health in providing and accessing sexual health services. There are important issues in relation to utilising and providing online sexual health services. For healthcare providers, e-health can act as an opportunity to enhance their clients' sexual health care by facilitating communication with full privacy and confidentiality, reducing administrative costs and improving efficiency and flexibility as well as market sexual health services and products. Sexual health is one of the common health topics which both younger and older people explore on the internet and they increasingly prefer sexual health education to be interactive, non-discriminate and anonymous. This commentary presents and discusses the benefits of e-sexual health and provides recommendations towards addressing some of the emerging challenges. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The provision of sexual health services can be enhanced through E-health technology. Doing this can empower consumers to engage with information technology to enhance their sexual health knowledge and quality of life and address some of the stigma associated with diversity in sexualities and sexual health experiences. In addition, e-sexual health may better support and enhance the relationship between consumers and their health care providers across different locations.

Concerning the use of IT in reproductive health, the aim of the diverse range of currently available applications (apps) is to assist in family planning, antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care, along with neonatal and infant healthcare. End users are healthcare workers or women. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of these solutions have demonstrated promising results reflecting adherence to healthcare services and recommendations, information on management and risk identification in pregnancy, improvement in women's satisfaction with healthcare received, in addition to financial benefits for the healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present review was to identify main apps and software that are currently available in mHealth, designed for use by health professionals during antenatal care. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted through a search for digital health solutions (mhealth/ehealth), apps and/or software, in publications after 2014, during antenatal care provision, in the Pubmed/Medline, Google Scholar databases and Google Play platform. Furthermore, relevant publications cited in bibliographic references of articles selected and unconventional sources (grey literature) were evaluated. Inclusion criteria for analysis of publications or tools were title or abstract descriptions of the following functions: use by health professionals during antenatal care provision, patient electronic record, integration of the app connecting the pregnant woman to the healthcare professional, clinical decision support system and use of mobile technology. The most recent article of duplicated information on apps or mobile health solutions was considered. Systematic review protocol (number CRD42017080501) was registered on PROSPERO in 2017. RESULTS: A search in the Pubmed/Medline database produced 235 results between Jan 2014 and June 2018, 7840 publications in the Google Scholar database; 422 apps in Google Play. The first review of article abstracts and/or descriptors of products available resulted in the exclusion of 8483 sources of data, remaining 14 apps for detailed analysis. Of these, 5 were excluded for failing to meet inclusion criteria or lack of clarity or availability of sufficient data for inclusion. CONCLUSION: The systematic review demonstrated that it is an arduous task to search for mobile digital solutions that meet the guidelines for clinical use during antenatal care.

We aimed to explore the use of these tools in multidisciplinary team meetings (MTMs) and to identify the critical challenges posed by their adoption based on the perspective of professionals representatives from European scientific societies. DESIGN: This qualitative study used discussion of cases and focus group technique to generate data. Thematic analysis was applied. SETTING: Healthcare professionals working in a multidisciplinary cancer care environment. PARTICIPANTS: Selection of informants was carried out by European scientific societies in accordance with professionals' degree of experience in adopting the implementation of ICT and from different health systems. RESULTS: Professionals representatives of 9 European scientific societies were involved. Up to 10 ICTs, HIS functionalities and care components are embedded in the informational and decision-making processes along three stages of MTMs. ICTs play a key role in opening MTMs to other institutions (eg, by means of molecular tumour boards) and information types (eg, patient-reported outcome measures), and in contributing to the internal efficiency of teams. While ICTs and care components have their own challenges, the information technology context is characterised by the massive generation of unstructured data, the lack of interoperability between systems from different hospitals and HIS that are conceived to store and classify information rather than to work with it.

Particularly in psychiatry, objective, continuous quantitation using patients' own devices may result in clinically useful markers that can be used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices, improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes, such as early signs of relapse, and develop new intervention models. If a principal goal for digital phenotyping is clinical improvement, research needs to attend now to factors that will help or hinder future clinical adoption. We identify four opportunities for research directed toward this goal: exploring intermediate outcomes and underlying disease mechanisms; focusing on purposes that are likely to be used in clinical practice; anticipating quality and safety barriers to adoption; and exploring the potential for digital personalized medicine arising from the integration of digital phenotyping and digital interventions. Clinical relevance also means explicitly addressing consumer needs, preferences, and acceptability as the ultimate users of digital phenotyping interventions. There is a risk that, without such considerations, the potential benefits of digital phenotyping are delayed or not realized because approaches that are feasible for application in healthcare, and the evidence required to support clinical commissioning, are not developed.

SOURCE: We first review the recent literature to determine if physician barriers to adoption are changing given the exponential growth of information technology and the evolving healthcare environment. We next report on institutional experience from two academic health sciences centres regarding the challenges they encountered over the past ten years in developing and implementing an electronic medical record system for acute pain management.

These barriers are identical to those reported in a systematic review performed prior to 2009 and remain significant factors challenging implementation. These challenges were encountered during our institution's process of adopting EMRs specific to acute pain management.

We have also developed EvalDB, a web-based database of evaluation studies to promulgate evidence about unintended effects and are developing the content for courses to improve training in health IT evaluation. CONCLUSION: Evaluation is an essential ingredient for the effective use of IT to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. WG resources and skills development initiatives can facilitate a proactive and evidence-based approach to detecting and addressing the unintended effects of health IT.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.15265/IY-2016-013,"Humans;*Medical Informatics/education;Organizational Policy;Patient Safety;Societies, Medical;Technology Assessment, Biomedical/methods/*standards;*Telemedicine",27830232,PMC5171579

Despite such investment, electronic health records designed to support emergency care have been poorly evaluated. Given the accelerated development and adoption of information technology across healthcare, it is timely that a systematic review of this evidence base is updated in order to drive improvements to design, interoperability and overall clinical utility of electronic health record systems implemented in emergency departments. To assess the impact of electronic health records on healthcare outcomes and efficiencies in the emergency department we carried out a systematic review of published studies on this topic. This is the first review to summarise the cost efficiencies associated with electronic health record use outside of just the United States of America. A systematic search was performed in three scientific databases (MEDLINE, EMcare and EMBASE), of literature published between January 2000 and September 2019. Studies were included in this review if they evaluated electronic health records or health information exchanges (and synonyms for these terms), reported patient outcome and/or healthcare efficiency benefits, were peer-reviewed and published in English. Out of 6635 articles, 23 studies met our inclusion criteria. Wide variation regarding electronic health record access in the emergency department was reported (1.46-56.6%), yet was most frequently reported as less than 20%. Seven different types of health outcomes and three different types of efficiency improvements associated with electronic health record use in the emergency department were identified. The most frequently reported findings were efficiencies, including reductions in diagnostic tests, imaging and costs. This review is the first to report moderate to significant increases in admission rates are associated with electronic health record use in the emergency department, contrasting the findings of previous reviews. Diversity in the methodology employed across the included studies emphasises the need for further research to examine the impact of electronic health record implementation and system design on the findings reported, in order to ensure return on investment for stakeholders and optimised consumer care.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1007/s10916-020-01660-0,"*Delivery of Health Care;*Electronic Health Records;Emergency Service, Hospital;Hospitals;Humans;Outcome Assessment, Health Care",33078276,

Hospitals are now federally mandated to showcase meaningful use of information technology (IT). We theorize that IT plan scope structured prior to a regulatory change by means of a long-term planning horizon, top management involvement, and steering committee engagement impacts organizations' ability to fulfill meaningful use requirements three to five years later. Furthermore, we contend that this impact is contingent on the specific IT adoption strategy. METHODS: Data from the HIMSS and HITECH Act databases were combined to analyze 688 hospitals. Regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: The results of this longitudinal study show that frequency of steering committee meetings and length of planning horizon broaden IT plan scope. Broader IT plan scope is positively associated with the ability of organizations to meaningfully use IT. CONCLUSIONS: The link between IT plan scope and meaningful use metric is particularly significant for organizations that adopt a more integrated approach towards IT adoption.

The complexity of healthcare creates barriers to transformational activity and has the potential to inhibit the desired paths toward change envisioned by policymakers. Methods for understanding how change is occurring within this complex environment are important to the evaluation of delivery system reform and the role of technology in healthcare transformation. This study examines the use on an integrative review methodology to evaluate the healthcare literature for evidence of technology transformation in healthcare. The methodology integrates the evaluation of a broad set of literature with an established evaluative framework to develop a more complete understanding of a particular topic. We applied this methodology and the framework of punctuated equilibrium (PEq) to the analysis of the healthcare literature from 2004 to 2012 for evidence of technology transformation, a time during which technology was at the forefront of healthcare policy. The analysis demonstrated that the established PEq framework applied to the literature showed considerable potential for evaluating the progress of policies that encourage healthcare transformation. Significant inhibitors to change were identified through the integrative review and categorized into ten themes that describe the resistant structure of healthcare delivery: variations in the environment; market complexity; regulations; flawed risks and rewards; change theories; barriers; ethical considerations; competition and sustainability; environmental elements, and internal elements. We hypothesize that the resistant nature of the healthcare system described by this study creates barriers to the direct consumer involvement and engagement necessary for transformational change. Future policies should be directed at removing these barriers by demanding and emphasizing open technologies and unrestricted access to data versus as currently prescribed by technology vendors, practitioners, and policies that perpetuate market equilibrium.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1016/j.jbi.2015.09.014,Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration;*Information Services,26429591,PMC4684715

There are realisable benefits of EHR adoption in LTC facilities; however, there is limited research about this topic. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify EHR adoption factors for LTC facilities that are ineligible for the HITECH Act incentives. SETTING: We conducted systematic searches of Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Complete via Ebson B. Stephens Company (EBSCO Host), Google Scholar and the university library search engine to collect data about EHR adoption factors in LTC facilities since 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Search results were filtered by date range, full text, English language and academic journals (n=22). INTERVENTIONS: Multiple members of the research team read each article to confirm applicability and study conclusions. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Researchers identified common themes across the literature: specifically facilitators and barriers to adoption of the EHR in LTC. RESULTS: Results identify facilitators and barriers associated with EHR adoption in LTC facilities. The most common facilitators include access to information and error reduction. The most prevalent barriers include initial costs, user perceptions and implementation problems. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities span the system selection phases and implementation process; of those, cost was the most common mentioned.

Thailand has implemented the national universal healthcare program and has been restructuring the country's health IT system to support it. However, there is no national data available regarding the acceptance and use of health IT in many healthcare facilities, including community health centers (CHCs). This study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) structural model, to understand factors that influence health IT adoption in community health centers in Thailand and to validate this extant IT adoption model in a developing country health care context. METHODS: An observational research design was employed to study CHCs' IT adoption and use. A random sample of 1607 regionally stratified CHC's from a total of 9806 CHCs was selected. Data collection was conducted using a cross-sectional survey by means of self-administered questionnaire with an 82% response rate. The research model was applied using the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling. RESULTS: The data showed that people who worked in CHCs exhibited a high degree of IT acceptance and use. The research model analyses suggest that IT acceptance is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and voluntariness. Health IT use is predicted by previous IT experiences, intention to use the system, and facilitating conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Health IT is pervasive and well adopted by CHCs in Thailand. The study results have implications for both health IT developmental efforts in Thailand and health informatics research. This study validated the UTAUT model in the field context of a developing country's healthcare system and demonstrated that the PLS path modeling works well in a field study and in exploratory research with a complex model.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Less Focus,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.12.005,Biomedical Technology/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data;Community Health Centers/*statistics & numerical data;Computer Simulation;Public Health Informatics/*organization & administration/*statistics & numerical           data;Thailand,19196548,

BACKGROUND: Implementation of new technology, such as electronic medical record systems, affects nurses and their work, workflows and inter-personal interactions in healthcare settings. Multiple individual and organisational-level factors can affect technology adoption by nurses and may have negative consequences for nurses and patient safety. DESIGN: Five-step realist review method and Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards checklist was used to guide this review. Eight initial theories (programme theories) were used as the basis to explore, examine and refine literature from a range of sources. DATA SOURCES: Literature from five databases (APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, IEEE Xplore and MEDLINE Complete) and grey literature (from 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2021) were systematically searched and retrieved on 4 November 2021. RESULTS: In all, 8980 records were screened at the title and abstract level, of which 1027 full texts were screened and 10 were included in the review. Seven studies assessed concepts in both pre- and post-technology implementation. Most common contexts related to knowledge, rationale and skills to use new technology. Mechanisms that impacted nurses or nursing care delivery included: nurses' involvement in technology implementation processes; nurses' perceptions, understanding and limitations of technology impact(s) on patient care delivery; social supports; skills; implementation attitude and hardware. Work satisfaction was the most frequently examined outcome. An analysis led to nine final programme theories (including two original, six revised and one new programme theory). CONCLUSION: Nurses must be informed about the rationale for new technology and have the knowledge and skills for its use. Understanding nurses' work motivation and attitudes related to technology adoption in the workplace can support work engagement, satisfaction and well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION: Complex contexts and mechanisms play a role in nurses' work motivation, engagement, satisfaction and well-being with the implementation of new technology into healthcare settings.

Theory-driven methods of compiling, evaluating, and integrating information from the academic and commercial sectors are necessary to guide stakeholder decision-making surrounding HIT adoption and to develop pragmatic HIT research agendas. This article presents the Health Information Technologies-Academic and Commercial Evaluation (HIT-ACE) methodology, a structured, theory-driven method for compiling and evaluating information from multiple sectors. As an example demonstration of the methodology, we apply HIT-ACE to mental and behavioral health measurement feedback systems (MFS). MFS are a specific class of HIT that support the implementation of routine outcome monitoring, an evidence-based practice. RESULTS: HIT-ACE is guided by theories and frameworks related to user-centered design and implementation science. The methodology involves four phases: (1) coding academic and commercial materials, (2) developer/purveyor interviews, (3) linking putative implementation mechanisms to hit capabilities, and (4) experimental testing of capabilities and mechanisms. In the current demonstration, phase 1 included a systematic process to identify MFS in mental and behavioral health using academic literature and commercial websites. Using user-centered design, implementation science, and feedback frameworks, the HIT-ACE coding system was developed, piloted, and used to review each identified system for the presence of 38 capabilities and 18 additional characteristics via a consensus coding process. Bibliometic data were also collected to examine the representation of the systems in the scientific literature. As an example, results are presented for the application of HIT-ACE phase 1 to MFS wherein 49 separate MFS were identified, reflecting a diverse array of characteristics and capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings demonstrate the utility of HIT-ACE to represent the scope and diversity of a given class of HIT beyond what can be identified in the academic literature. Phase 2 data collection is expected to confirm and expand the information presented and phases 3 and 4 will provide more nuanced information about the impact of specific HIT capabilities.

By combining the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with the health belief model (HBM), and including risk perception of information technology with the farsighted planner and myopic doer from the theory of self-control, we explore the understanding of this academic question. We analyzed data from 8,840 users of Boohee, a diet and fitness app (ranked first in the weight-loss category on the App Store in China). Structural equation modeling revealed that self-efficacy as well as the perceived benefits, barriers, and threats of weight loss significantly influence a fitness app's performance expectancy, which, in turn, predicts users' intention to adopt it. Furthermore, actual usage behavior (i.e., diet, exercise, weight, and login records within 30 days after respondents completed the questionnaire) is positively affected by weight-loss intention and behavioral intention to use the app and negatively affected by users' risk perception. The main findings of this research could help healthcare practitioners and app developers find better ways to encourage people to adopt health apps for various reasons. App developers should attach more importance to users' actual continuous use behavior than to their intention to use an app. They should provide sufficient introductory information about their apps, thereby reducing users' risk perception and generating reasonable performance expectancy of the app, so as to improve users' actual continuous use behavior.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Less Focus,10.1080/10410236.2020.1724637,China;Exercise;Humans;Intention;*Mobile Applications;Surveys and Questionnaires,32041437,

In contrast, computer technology utilized within the healthcare industry often evolves at a glacial pace, with reduced opportunities for justified innovation. Although the use of timely technology refreshes within an enterprise's overall technology stack can be costly, thoughtful adoption of select technologies with a demonstrated return on investment can be very effective in increasing productivity and at the same time, reducing the burden of maintenance often associated with older and legacy systems. In this brief technical communication, we introduce the concept of microservices as applied to the ecosystem of data analysis pipelines. Microservice architecture is a framework for dividing complex systems into easily managed parts. Each individual service is limited in functional scope, thereby conferring a higher measure of functional isolation and reliability to the collective solution. Moreover, maintenance challenges are greatly simplified by virtue of the reduced architectural complexity of each constitutive module. This fact notwithstanding, rendered overall solutions utilizing a microservices-based approach provide equal or greater levels of functionality as compared to conventional programming approaches. Bioinformatics, with its ever-increasing demand for performance and new testing algorithms, is the perfect use-case for such a solution. Moreover, if promulgated within the greater development community as an open-source solution, such an approach holds potential to be transformative to current bioinformatics software development. CONTEXT: Bioinformatics relies on nimble IT framework which can adapt to changing requirements.

The first objective is to identify the antecedents towards safety use of health IT by conducting systematic literature review (SLR). The second objective is to classify the identified antecedents based on the work system in Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model and an extension of DeLone and McLean (D&M) information system (IS) success model. METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted from peer-reviewed scholarly publications between January 2000 and July 2014. SLR was carried out and reported based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The related articles were identified by searching the articles published in Science Direct, Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Data extracted from the resultant studies included are to be analysed based on the work system in Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, and also from the extended DeLone and McLean (D&M) information system (IS) success model. RESULTS: 55 articles delineated to be antecedents that influenced the safety use of health IT were included for review. Antecedents were identified and then classified into five key categories. The categories are (1) person, (2) technology, (3) tasks, (4) organization, and (5) environment. Specifically, person is attributed by competence while technology is associated to system quality, information quality, and service quality. Tasks are attributed by task-related stressor. Organisation is related to training, organisation resources, and teamwork. Lastly, environment is attributed by physical layout, and noise. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that the antecedents for safety use of health IT originated from both social and technical aspects. However, inappropriate health IT usage potentially increases the incidence of errors and produces new safety risks. The review cautions future implementation and adoption of health IT to carefully consider the complex interactions between social and technical elements propound in healthcare settings.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.07.004,Attitude of Health Personnel;Attitude to Computers;Electronic Health Records;Humans;Medical Errors/*prevention & control;*Medical Informatics/methods/organization & administration/standards;Meta-Analysis as Topic;*Patient Safety/standards;Quality of Health Care,26238706,

Knowledge of these factors may inform future research and implementations. No reviews have provided an overview of the use of text-based two-way communication after discharge and the identified facilitators and barriers. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review is to systematically identify and map available research that assess the use of text-based two-way communication between patients and healthcare professionals after hospital discharge, including facilitators and barriers to implementation.

Health information technology (HIT) holds vast potential for helping patients, providers, and payers to address T2D and the skyrocketing rates of chronic illness and associated health care costs. Patient portals to electronic health records (EHRs) serve as a gateway to consumer use of HIT. We found that disparities in portal use portend growing T2D disparities. Little progress has been made in addressing identified barriers to technology adoption, especially among populations with elevated risk of T2D. Patients often lack digital literacy skills and continuous connectivity and fear loss of the relationship with providers. Providers may experience structural disincentives to promoting patient use of HIT and apply hidden biases that inhibit portal use. Health care systems often provide inadequate training to patients and providers in use of HIT, and lack resources devoted to obtaining and optimizing use of data generated by HIT. Lastly, technology-related barriers include inadequate consideration of user perspectives, lack of evidence for patient-focused apps, and lack of features to enable providers and health care systems to readily obtain aggregate data to improve care and facilitate research. After discussing these barriers in detail, we propose possible solutions and areas where further research is needed to ensure that individuals and health care systems obtain the full benefit of the nation's planned $38 billion HIT investment.

PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between IT adoption and quality of care in acute-care hospitals. METHODS: Primary data on hospital IT adoption were combined with secondary hospital discharge data. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between various measures of IT adoption and several quality indicators after controlling for confounders. Adoption of IT was measured using a previously validated method that considers clinical, administrative, and strategic IT capabilities of acute-care hospitals. Quality measures included the Inpatient Quality Indicators developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. RESULTS: Data from 98 hospitals were available for analyses. Hospitals adopted an average of 11.3 (45.2%) clinical IT applications, 15.7 (74.8%) administrative IT applications, and 5 (50%) strategic IT applications. In multivariate regression analyses, hospitals that adopted a greater number of IT applications were significantly more likely to have desirable quality outcomes on seven Inpatient Quality Indicator measures, including risk-adjusted mortality from percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction. An increase in clinical IT applications was also inversely correlated with utilization of incidental appendectomy, and an increase in the adoption of strategic IT applications was inversely correlated with risk-adjusted mortality from craniotomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

In economic terms, the incentives of the major players in health care may work against new IT, which fosters process and organizational innovation much more than product innovation. While product innovation causes an increase in consumers' willingness to pay and is therefore welcomed by those working in the healthcare sector, process innovation is resisted because it often means performing the same service but at a lower cost. This is also true of organizational innovation, which frequently entails vertical integration and hence a loss of autonomy (as evidenced by the difficulties of creating Managed Care Organizations).

The field of health information technology is evolving rapidly with innovations and policies often outpacing science. We sought to review research and discussions about electronic medical records from the past year to keep abreast of these changes.

Adoption rates are slowly increasing, but more of the burden is shouldered by physicians despite policy efforts and the clear benefits to third-party payers. Scientific research from the past year suggests lack of improvements and even decreasing quality of healthcare with electronic medical record adoption in the ambulatory care setting. The increasing prevalence and standardization of electronic medical record systems results in a new set of problems including rising costs, audits, difficulties in transition and public concerns about security of information.

METHODS: Primary data were sourced from 1222 hospitals that responded to the National Survey of Lean (NSL)/Transformational Performance Improvement, which was fielded to 4500 general medical-surgical hospitals across the United States. Secondary sources included hospital performance data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We performed 2 sets of multivariable regressions using data gathered from US hospitals, linked to AHRQ and CMS performance outcomes. We examined 10 different outcomes measuring financial performance, quality of care, and patient experience, and their associations with Lean adoption within hospital IT departments. We then focused only on those hospitals that adopted Lean in IT to identify specific practices associated with performance. RESULTS: Controlling for other factors, adoption of Lean IT management was associated with lower length of stay (b = -0.098, P = .018) and inpatient expense per discharge (b = -0.112, P = .090).

Despite its great importance, the adoptions of EHR in low-income country settings, like Ethiopia, were lagging and increasingly failed. Assessing the readiness of stakeholders before the actual adoption of EHR is considered the prominent solution to tackle the problem. However, little is known about healthcare providers' EHR readiness in this study setting. Accordingly, this research was conducted aiming at examining healthcare providers' readiness for EHR adoption and associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 to October 30, 2021. A total of 423 healthcare providers working in public hospitals were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Multivariable logistic regression was fitted to identify determinant factors of overall healthcare providers' readiness after the other covariates were controlled. RESULT: In this study, the overall good readiness level of EHR adoption was 52.8% (n = 204) [95% CI of 47.9% to 56.6%]. Age, computer literacy, computer access at health facilities, attitude towards EHRs, awareness about EHRs, perceived benefit, and perceived technology self-efficacy were significantly associated with the overall health care providers' readiness for the adoption of EHR using a cut point of P-value less than 0.05. CONCLUSION: Around half of the respondents had a good level of overall healthcare providers' readiness for the adoption of EHR which was considered inadequate. This finding implied that a huge effort is required to improve readiness before the actual implementation of EHRs. The finding implied that younger-aged groups were more ready for such technology which in turn implied; the older one needs more concern. Enhancing computer literacy, confidence building to raise self-efficacy of such technology, addressing the issue of computer availability at health facilities, building a positive attitude, awareness campaign of EHR, and recognizing the usefulness of such systems were the necessary measures to improve EHR readiness in this setting. Additionally, further studies are recommended to encompass all types of EHR readiness such as organizational readiness, technology readiness, societal readiness, and so on.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis of cross sectional data was compiled from four sources: (1) State Inpatient Database from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project; (2) Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Dorenfest Institute; (3) Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey (HCAHPS) and (4) New Jersey nurse survey data. The final analytic sample consisted of data on 854,258 adult patients discharged from 70 New Jersey hospitals in 2006 and 7,679 nurses working in those same hospitals. The analytic approach used ordinary least squares and multiple regression models to estimate the effects of EHR adoption stage on the delivery of nursing care and patient outcomes, controlling for characteristics of patients, nurses, and hospitals. RESULTS: Advanced EHR adoption was independently associated with fewer patients with prolonged length of stay and seven-day readmissions. Advanced EHR adoption was not associated with patient satisfaction even when controlling for the strong relationships between better nursing practice environments, particularly staffing and resource adequacy, and missed nursing care and more patients reporting ""Top-Box,"" satisfaction ratings. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative study demonstrated that advanced stages of EHR adoption show some promise in improving important patient outcomes of prolonged length of stay and hospital readmissions. Strongly evident by the relationships among better nursing work environments, better quality nursing care, and patient satisfaction is the importance of supporting the fundamentals of quality nursing care as technology is integrated into practice.","",,"",27570443,PMC5001503

This study surveys DS experience across multiple non-healthcare disciplines for new insights that are generalizable to healthcare provider decisions. In particular, it sought design principles and lessons learned from the other disciplines that could inform efforts to accelerate the adoption of clinical decision support (CDS). METHODS: Our systematic review drew broadly from non-healthcare databases in the basic sciences, social sciences, humanities, engineering, business, and defense: PsychINFO, BusinessSource Premier, Social Sciences Abstracts, Web of Science, and Defense Technical Information Center. Because our interest was in DS that could apply to clinical decisions, we selected articles that (1) provided a review, overview, discussion of lessons learned, or an evaluation of design or implementation aspects of DS within a non-healthcare discipline and (2) involved an element of human judgment at the individual level, as opposed to decisions that can be fully automated or that are made at the organizational level. RESULTS: Clinical decisions share some similarities with decisions made by military commanders, business managers, and other leaders: they involve assessing new situations and choosing courses of action with major consequences, under time pressure, and with incomplete information. We identified seven high-level DS system design features from the non-healthcare literature that could be applied to CDS: providing broad, system-level perspectives; customizing interfaces to specific users and roles; making the DS reasoning transparent; presenting data effectively; generating multiple scenarios covering disparate outcomes (e.g., effective; effective with side effects; ineffective); allowing for contingent adaptations; and facilitating collaboration. The article provides examples of each feature. The DS literature also emphasizes the importance of organizational culture and training in implementation success. The literature contrasts ""rational-analytic"" vs. ""naturalistic-intuitive"" decision-making styles, but the best approach is often a balanced approach that combines both styles. It is also important for DS systems to enable exploration of multiple assumptions, and incorporation of new information in response to changing circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: Complex, high-level decision-making has common features across disciplines as seemingly disparate as defense, business, and healthcare. National efforts to advance the health information technology agenda through broader CDS adoption could benefit by applying the DS principles identified in this review.","",10.1186/1472-6947-12-90,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical;*Diffusion of Innovation;Program Development;*Technology Transfer",22900537,PMC3524755

Computer-assisted clinical coding (CAC) has made it possible to automate the clinical coding process by assigning diagnoses and procedures from electronic sources of clinical documentation. Implementation of CAC requires both investigation of the clinical coding workflow and exploration of how the clinical coding professional's role might change and evolve as a result of this technology. OBJECTIVE: To examine the benefits and limitations of CAC technology; best practices for CAC adoption; the impact of CAC on traditional coding practices and roles in the inpatient setting. METHOD: This narrative review explores the current literature available on CAC. Literature indexed in ProQuest, Medline and other relevant sources between January 2006 and June 2017 was considered. RESULTS: A total of 38 journal articles, published dissertations and case studies revealed that CAC has demonstrated value in improving clinical coding accuracy and quality, which can be missed during the manual clinical coding process. CONCLUSION: Clinical coding professionals should view CAC as an opportunity not a threat. CAC will allow clinical coding professionals to further develop their clinical coding skills and knowledge for future career progression into new roles such as clinical coding editors and clinical coding analysts. Sound change management strategies are essential for successful restructuring of the clinical coding workflows during the implementation of CAC.","",10.1177/1833358319851305,*Automation;Clinical Coding/*standards;*Data Accuracy;Forms and Records Control/*standards;Humans;International Classification of Diseases;Medical Record Administrators/*standards;Medical Records/standards;Professional Competence;*Professional Role,31159578,

In 2000, the Saudi government established a committee for health reform to develop an information technology strategic plan for healthcare and for deploying e-health applications within the country. The objective of e-health systems was to provide better healthcare to patients and to increase the efficiency of healthcare organizations. Despite numerous e-health interventions to provide healthcare services, very little is studied about the adoption process of e-health from users' viewpoints in Saudi Arabia. This study minimizes this knowledge gap by studying the factors affecting the adoption and acceptance of e-health in the context of Saudi Arabia.Materials and Methods: This study has combined theTechnology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior frameworks to evaluate the factors influencing the patient acceptance of e-health services in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from patients at various private and public hospitals in Saudi Arabia.

However, it has been frequently reported that more than 40% of previous information technology (IT) developments have failed or been abandoned due to the lack of understanding of the sociotechnical aspects of IT. OBJECTIVE: Previous home healthcare robots research has focused on technology development and clinical applications. There has been little discussion of associated social, technical and managerial issues that are arguably of equal importance for robot success. To fill this knowledge gap, this research aims to understand the determinants of home healthcare robots adoption from these aspects by applying technology acceptance theories. METHODS: We employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies located in the U.S. (n=108), which included both patients and healthcare professionals. We collected data via a survey study to test a research model. RESULTS: The usage intention of home healthcare robots is a function of social influence, performance expectancy, trust, privacy concerns, ethical concerns and facilitating conditions. Among them, social influence is the strongest predictor. Monitoring vital signs and facilitating communication with family and medication reminders are the most preferable tasks and applications for robots. CONCLUSION: Sociotechnical factors play a powerful role in explaining the adoption intention for home healthcare robots. The findings provide insights on how home healthcare service providers and robot designers may improve the success of robot technologies.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.07.003,*Attitude to Health;Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data;Home Care Services/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology/*statistics & numerical data;Robotics/*statistics & numerical data;United States;*Utilization Review,25132284,

Search terms related to different components of systems, hospital settings and antimicrobial stewardship. Two reviewers independently screened papers and mutually agreed papers for inclusion. We undertook an interpretive synthesis. KEY FINDINGS: We identified 143 papers. The majority of these were single-centre observational studies from North American settings with a wide range of system functionalities. Most evidence related to computerised decision support (CDS) and computerised physician order entry (CPOE) functionalities, of which many were extensively customised. We also found some limited work surrounding integration with laboratory results, pharmacy systems and organisational surveillance. Outcomes examined included healthcare professional performance, patient outcomes and health economic evaluations. We found at times conflicting conclusions surrounding effectiveness, which may be due to heterogeneity of populations, technologies and outcomes studied. Reports of unintended consequences were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are centred on CPOE and CDS, but also include additional functionality aiming to support various facets of the medicines management process. Wider organisational dimensions appear important to supporting adoption. Evaluations should consider processes, clinical, economic and safety outcomes in order to generate generalisable insights into safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.","",10.1111/ijpp.12274,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;*Electronic Prescribing;Humans;Medical Order Entry Systems",27198585,

The low uptake of mHealth in policy agendas may stem from a lack of evidence of the scalable, sustainable impact on health indicators. The mHealth literature in low- and middle-income countries reveals a burgeoning body of knowledge; yet, existing reviews suggest that the projects yield mixed results. This article adopts a stage-based approach to understand the varied contributions to mHealth research. The heuristic of inputs-mechanism-outputs is proposed as a tool to categorize mHealth studies. This review (63 articles comprising 53 studies) reveals that mHealth studies in developing countries tend to concentrate on specific stages, principally on pilot projects that adopt a deterministic approach to technological inputs (n = 32), namely introduction and implementation. Somewhat less studied were research designs that demonstrate evidence of outputs (n = 15), such as improvements in healthcare processes and public health indicators. The review finds a lack of emphasis on studies that provide theoretical understanding (n = 6) of adoption and appropriation of technological introduction that produces measurable health outcomes. As a result, there is a lack of dominant theory, or measures of outputs relevant to making policy decisions. Future work needs to aim for establishing theoretical and measurement standards, particularly from social scientific perspectives, in collaboration with researchers from the domains of information technology and public health. Priorities should be set for investments and guidance in evaluation disseminated by the scientific community to practitioners and policymakers.","",10.1080/10810730.2013.864735,Cell Phone/*statistics & numerical data;*Developing Countries;Humans;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Telemedicine/*organization & administration,24673171,

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this pilot study was to identify consumer perspectives on health information technologies including health information exchange (HIE), e-prescribing (e-Rx), and personal health records (PHRs). METHODS: Eight focus groups were conducted in seven towns and cities across Nebraska in 2013. Each group consisted of 10-12 participants. Discussions were organized topically in the following categories: HIE, e-Rx, and PHR. The qualitative analysis consisted of immersion and crystallization to develop a coding scheme that included both preconceived and emergent themes. Common themes across focus groups were identified and compiled for each discussion category. RESULTS: The study had 67 participants, of which 18 (27 percent) were male. Focus group findings revealed both perceived barriers and benefits to the adoption of HIT. Common HIT concerns expressed across focus groups included privacy and security of medical information, decreases in quality of care, inconsistent provider participation, and the potential cost of implementation. Positive expectations regarding HIT included better accuracy and completeness of information, and improved communication and coordination between healthcare providers. Improvements in patient care were expected as a result of easy physician access to consolidated information across providers as well as the speed of sharing and availability of information in an emergency. In addition, participants were optimistic about patient empowerment and convenient access to and control of personal health data. CONCLUSION: Consumer concerns focused on privacy and security of the health information, as well as the cost of implementing the technologies and the possibility of an unintended negative impact on the quality of care.

In this article, we argue that analytics will play a fundamental role in the transformation of the American healthcare system. However, there are numerous challenges to the application and use of analytics, namely the lack of data standards, barriers to the collection of high-quality data, and a shortage of qualified personnel to conduct such analyses. There are also multiple managerial issues, such as how to get end users of electronic data to employ it consistently for improving healthcare delivery, and how to manage the public reporting and sharing of data.

However, it is less clear whether the benefits of greater access to online health information and health information technologies is equitably distributed across population groups, particularly to those who are underserved. To examine this issue, this article employs the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to investigate relationships between a variety of socio-economic variables and the use of the web-based technologies for health information seeking, personal health information management and patient-provider communication within the context of the USA. This study reveals interesting patterns in technology adoption, some of which are in line with previous studies, while others are less clear. Whether these patterns indicate early evidence of a narrowing divide in eHealth technology use across population groups as a result of the narrowing divide in Internet access and computer ownership warrants further exploration. In particular, the findings emphasize the need to explore differences in the use of eHealth tools by medically underserved and disadvantaged groups. In so doing, it will be important to explore other psychosocial variables, such as health literacy, that may be better predictors of health consumers' eHealth technology adoption.","",10.1177/1460458211414843,"Adult;Age Distribution;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Community Participation/methods/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Health Education/*methods/*statistics & numerical data;Health Surveys;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods;Internet/*statistics & numerical data;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Sex Distribution;Socioeconomic Factors;Surveys and Questionnaires;Technology Assessment, Biomedical;United States;User-Computer Interface;Young Adult",21937464,

Insufficiencies have been identified, such as lack of integration, need of accommodation of diverse biometric sensors, and accessing diverse networks as different houses have varying facilities, which challenge the promotion of telehealthcare. This study designs an information technology framework to strengthen telehealthcare delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed framework consists of a system architecture design and a network transmission design. The aim of the framework is to integrate data from existing information systems, to adopt medical informatics standards, to integrate diverse biometric sensors, and to provide different data transmission networks to support a patient's house network despite the facilities. The proposed framework has been evaluated with a case study of two telehealthcare programs, with and without the adoption of the framework. RESULTS: The proposed framework facilitates the functionality of the program and enables steady patient enrollments. The overall patient participations are increased, and the patient outcomes appear positive. The attitudes toward the service and self-improvement also are positive.

We explore information security practices and identify practice patterns that are associated with improved regulatory compliance. DESIGN: We employed Ward's cluster analysis using minimum variance based on the adoption of security practices. Variance between organizations was measured using dichotomous data indicating the presence or absence of each security practice. Using t tests, we identified the relationships between the clusters of security practices and their regulatory compliance. MEASUREMENT: We utilized the results from the Kroll/Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society telephone-based survey of 250 US healthcare organizations including adoption status of security practices, breach incidents, and perceived compliance levels on Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Red Flags rules, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state laws governing patient information security. RESULTS: Our analysis identified three clusters (which we call leaders, followers, and laggers) based on the variance of security practice patterns. The clusters have significant differences among non-technical practices rather than technical practices, and the highest level of compliance was associated with hospitals that employed a balanced approach between technical and non-technical practices (or between one-off and cultural practices). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals in the highest level of compliance were significantly managing third parties' breaches and training. Audit practices were important to those who scored in the middle of the pack on compliance. Our results provide security practice benchmarks for healthcare administrators and can help policy makers in developing strategic and practical guidelines for practice adoption.","",10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000906,American Recovery and Reinvestment Act;Cluster Analysis;*Computer Security;*Confidentiality;Discriminant Analysis;*Guideline Adherence;Health Care Surveys;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act;Humans;*Medical Informatics;United States,22955497,PMC3555315

Studies have shown that digital technology can improve access and support rural health by overcoming geographic barriers to care. OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the rates of ownership and preferences for utilization of DHT as a measure of interest among rural adults compared to their urban counterparts in the United States using a National Inpatient Survey. METHODS:  Data was drawn from the 2019 (n= 5438) iteration of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5 cycle 3). Chi-square tests and weighted multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine rural-urban differences regarding ownership, usage, and use of digital health tools to interact with health care systems while adjusting for health-related characteristics and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: The ownership rates of digital health technology (DHT) devices, including tablets, smart phones, health apps, and wearable devices, were comparable between rural and urban residents. For tablets, the ownership rates were 54.52% among rural residents and 60.24% among urban residents, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.87 (95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.61, 1.24). The ownership rates of health apps were 51.41% and 53.35% among rural and urban residents, respectively, with an adjusted OR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.42). For smartphones, the ownership rates were 81.64% among rural residents and 84.10% among urban residents, with an adjusted OR of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.11). Additionally, rural residents were equally likely to use DHT in managing their healthcare needs. Both groups were equally likely to have reported their smart device as helpful in discussions with their healthcare providers (OR 0.90; 95% CI 63 - 1.30; p = 0.572). Similarly, there were similar odds of reporting that DHT had helped them to track progress on a health-related goal (e.g., quitting smoking, losing weight, or increasing physical activity) (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.75 - 1.83; p = 0.491), and to make medical decisions (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.70 - 1.59; p = 0.797). However, they had lower rates of internet access and were less likely to use DHT for communicating with their healthcare providers. CONCLUSION:  We found that rural residents are equally likely as urban residents to own and use DHT to manage their health. However, they were less likely to communicate with their health providers using DHT. With increasing use of DHT in healthcare, future research that targets reasons for geographical digital access disparities is warranted.","",10.7759/cureus.38417,"",37273368,PMC10233341

APPROACH: Initial pilot telemedicine and eHealth programmes were not coordinated at national level. However, in 2011, a national eHealth policy was implemented. LOCAL SETTING: Bangladesh has made substantial improvements to its health system. However, the country still faces public health challenges with limited and inequitable access to health services and lack of adequate resources to meet the demands of the population. RELEVANT CHANGES: In 2008, eHealth services were introduced, including computerization of health facilities at sub-district levels, internet connections, internet servers and an mHealth service for communicating with health-care providers. Health facilities at sub-district levels were provided with internet connections and servers. In 482 upazila health complexes and district hospitals, an mHealth service was set-up where an on-duty doctor is available for patients at all hours to provide consultations by mobile phone. A government operated telemedicine service was initiated and by 2014, 43 fully equipped centres were in service. These centres provide medical consultations by qualified physicians to patients visiting rural and remote community clinics and union health centres. LESSONS LEARNT: Despite early pilot interventions and successful implementation, progress in adopting eHealth strategies in Bangladesh has been slow. There is a lack of common standards on information technology for health, which causes difficulties in data management and sharing among different databases. Limited internet bandwidth and the high cost of infrastructure and software development are barriers to adoption of these technologies.","",10.2471/BLT.15.153684,Bangladesh;Health Policy;*Health Services Accessibility;Humans;Medical Informatics/methods/organization & administration;Private Sector;Public Sector;Rural Health Services;Telemedicine/*methods/*organization & administration,26549909,PMC4622159

Healthcare informatics solutions development should diligently acknowledge end-user needs. This study compares a user experience and perceived quality of the nursing process integration in two different applications for electronic documentation of the nursing care plan. Both applications were designed and tested in Slovenia. METHODS: In the first phase, final year undergraduate nursing students were recruited (n=73) and randomly assigned into two groups. Each group used one of the applications for a duration of five hours. A survey among students was conducted. In the second phase, additional students were recruited (n=40) and invited to participate in qualitative analysis of the unfavourably rated application. RESULTS: The modern, visually improved application was favourably rated by students in terms of all aspects of application usability. However, students reported a significant number of inadequacies regarding the nursing process methodology integration. On the contrary, the students using the poorly rated and visually outdated application reported no such concerns. Qualitative analysis of student reflections identified additional positive features of software design that were not detected in survey results analysis. CONCLUSION: This study showed that a user-centred approach can be used to compare diverse electronic solutions. Detected discrepancies in findings using qualitative and quantitative analysis show the importance of integrating diverse research approaches for adequate evaluation of software solutions. Furthermore, this study design promotes empowerment of healthcare workers to participate in the development and critical evaluations of software solutions.","",10.2478/sjph-2022-0019,"",35855380,PMC9245498

In India, most adults with these conditions remain undiagnosed, untreated, or poorly treated and uncontrolled. Innovative and scalable approaches to deliver proven-effective strategies for medical and lifestyle management of these conditions are needed. METHODS: The overall goal of this implementation science study is to evaluate the Integrated Tracking, Referral, Electronic decision support, and Care coordination (I-TREC) program. I-TREC leverages information technology (IT) to manage hypertension and diabetes in adults aged ≥30 years across the hierarchy of Indian public healthcare facilities. The I-TREC program combines multiple evidence-based interventions: an electronic case record form (eCRF) to consolidate and track patient information and referrals across the publicly-funded healthcare system; an electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assist clinicians to provide tailored guideline-based care to patients; a revised workflow to ensure coordinated care within and across facilities; and enhanced training for physicians and nurses regarding non-communicable disease (NCD) medical content and lifestyle management. The program will be implemented and evaluated in a predominantly rural district of Punjab, India. The evaluation will employ a quasi-experimental design with mixed methods data collection. Evaluation indicators assess changes in the continuum of care for hypertension and diabetes and are grounded in the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data will be triangulated from multiple sources, including community surveys, health facility assessments, stakeholder interviews, and patient-level data from the I-TREC program's electronic database. DISCUSSION: I-TREC consolidates previously proven strategies for improved management of hypertension and diabetes at single-levels of the healthcare system into a scalable model for coordinated care delivery across all levels of the healthcare system hierarchy. Findings have the potential to inform best practices to ultimately deliver quality public-sector hypertension and diabetes care across India.

We examined health system- and physician practice-level capabilities associated with adoption of (1) patient engagement strategies and (2) chronic care management processes for adult patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data collected from the National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems, a nationally representative survey of physician practices (n = 796) and health systems (n = 247) (2017-2018). METHODS: Multivariable multilevel linear regression models estimated system- and practice-level characteristics associated with practice adoption of patient engagement strategies and chronic care management processes. RESULTS: Health systems with processes to assess clinical evidence (β = 6.54 points on a 0-100 scale; P = .004) and with more advanced health information technology (HIT) functionality (β = 2.77 points per SD increase on a 0-100 scale; P = .03) adopted more practice-level chronic care management processes, but not patient engagement strategies, compared with systems lacking these capabilities. Physician practices with cultures oriented to innovation, more advanced HIT functionality, and with a process to assess clinical evidence adopted more patient engagement strategies and chronic care management processes. CONCLUSIONS: Health systems may be better able to support the adoption of practice-level chronic care management processes, which have a strong evidence base for implementation, compared with patient engagement strategies, which have less evidence to guide effective implementation. Health systems have an opportunity to advance patient-centered care by expanding practice-level HIT functionality and developing processes to appraise clinical evidence for practices.","",10.37765/ajmc.2023.89348,Humans;Patient Participation;*Cardiovascular Diseases/therapy;*Diabetes Mellitus/therapy;Patient-Centered Care;Chronic Disease/therapy;*Disease Management;*Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration,37104834,

However, if knowledge is managed well with Knowledge Management (KM), then it becomes a source for sustainable competitive advantage for organizations. If KM is implemented in an organization, it would improve the organizational competitiveness, performance, and productivity, and facilitate the efficient use of resources. Due to intense competition in the global market, many organizations are moving towards the adoption of KM. The healthcare sectors of many developed countries have moved towards the implementation of KM because it can improve the procuring of knowledge from ongoing activities by the effective use of data repositories. Developing countries have now realized the potential and benefits of KM adoption. Pakistan is one of the developing countries that have recently shown an inclination towards the adoption of KM in its healthcare sector to improve performance of its healthcare. This study was composed of two main research phases. Firstly, the enablers of KM were reviewed from earlier studies. Secondly, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and MICMAC (Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification) techniques were used to show the interrelationships between KM enablers and driving and dependence power of each enabler. The application of ISM and MICMAC technique shows that policy incentive, long-term strategic planning, Information Technology (IT), and alignment of KM efforts with business strategy are the main enablers of KM adoption in the healthcare of Pakistan. Focusing on the identified enablers will help in the implementation of KM.

RESULTS: Overall, public hospitals had made positive progress in their compliance with the information management standard. However, issues still existed with (i) developing and implementing an information management plan, (ii) involving the appropriate stakeholders in selecting health IT solutions and (iii) access to the Internet by staff and patients. CONCLUSION: Evidence underscored the importance of proper information management driven by clear centralised strategic plans. IMPLICATIONS: With the rapid adoption of digital health systems, the role of health information management leaders should not be undervalued. Embracing health IT solutions with strong information management practices can aid healthcare reform efforts.","",10.1177/1833358319837247,"Accreditation;Guideline Adherence;Health Care Reform;Health Information Management/*standards;*Hospitals, Public;Kuwait;Quality Improvement",30894029,

OBJECTIVE: This study summarizes and shares the experiences with EHR adoption in China and in the United States. METHODS: Using the 2007-2018 annual hospital survey data from the Chinese Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) and the 2008-2017 United States American Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement survey data, we compared the trends in EHR adoption rates in China and the United States. We then used the Bass model to fit these data and to analyze the modes of diffusion of EHRs in these 2 countries. Finally, using the 2007, 2010, and 2014 CHIMA and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Services survey data, we analyzed the major challenges faced by hospitals in China and the United States in developing health information technology. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2018, the average adoption rates of the sampled hospitals in China increased from 18.6% to 85.3%, compared to the increase from 9.4% to 96% in US hospitals from 2008 to 2017. The annual average adoption rates in Chinese and US hospitals were 6.1% and 9.6%, respectively. However, the annual average number of hospitals adopting EHRs was 1500 in China and 534 in the US, indicating that the former might require more effort. Both countries faced similar major challenges for hospital digitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption rates of hospital EHRs in China and the United States have both increased significantly in the past 10 years. The number of hospitals that adopted EHRs in China exceeded 16,000, which was 3.3 times that of the 4814 nonfederal US hospitals. This faster adoption outcome may have been a benefit of top-level design and government-led policies, particularly the inclusion of EHR adoption as an important indicator for performance evaluation and the appointment of public hospitals.","",10.2196/24813,China;*Data Analysis;Electronic Health Records/*standards;Humans;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time Factors;United States,33599615,PMC7932845

This article examines the facility characteristics that are associated with health IT adoption. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a secondary data analysis of information gathered between 2005 and 2011 about nursing facility characteristics contained in the Online Certification & Reporting (OSCAR) files and information about health IT adoption in each nursing home contained in the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics Database. Multivariate regression analysis is conducted. RESULTS: Nursing homes with licensed nursing staff levels above the state average were 20% more likely to adopt computer-provided order entry (CPOE) than homes with licensed nursing staff below average. Resident resources (more Medicare-paid patients and fewer Medicaid patients) were positively correlated to health IT adoption, particularly to a clinical data repository (CDR), clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and an order entry (OE) system. Other characteristics, including chain affiliation, ownership, and market competition, are also related to some health IT adoption within nursing homes. IMPLICATION: Nursing homes with more personnel or resident resources are more likely to adopt health IT. Other factors such as market competition are also important predictors. Future research is needed to examine what factors motivate nursing homes to adopt health IT.","",10.1016/j.jamda.2016.02.028,*Diffusion of Innovation;Humans;*Medical Informatics;*Nursing Homes;Quality of Health Care;Regression Analysis;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States,27107160,

The electronic medical record maturity model (EMRAM) is a widely used survey tool developed by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) to measure the rate of adoption of EHR functions in a hospital or a secondary care setting. Turkey completed many standardizations and infrastructural improvement initiatives in the health information technology (IT) domain during the first phase of the Health Transformation Program between 2003 and 2017. Like the United States of America (USA), the Turkish Ministry of Health (MoH) applied a bottom-up approach to adopting EHRs in state hospitals. This study aims to measure adoption rates and levels of EHR use in state hospitals in Turkey and investigate any relationship between adoption and use and hospital size. METHODS: EMRAM surveys were completed by 600 (68.9%) state hospitals in Turkey between 2014 and 2017. The availability and prevalence of medical information systems and EHR functions and their use were measured. The association between hospital size and the availability/prevalence of EHR functions was also calculated. RESULTS: We found that 63.1% of all hospitals in Turkey have at least basic EHR functions, and 36% have comprehensive EHR functions, which compares favourably to the results of Korean hospitals in 2017, but unfavorably to the results of US hospitals in 2015 and 2017. Our findings suggest that smaller hospitals are better at adopting certain EHR functions than larger hospitals. CONCLUSION: Measuring the overall adoption rates of EHR functions is an emerging approach and a beneficial tool for the strategic management of countries. This study is the first one covering all state hospitals in a country using EMRAM. The bottom-up approach to adopting EHR in state hospitals that was successful in the USA has also been found to be successful in Turkey. The results are used by the Turkish MoH to disseminate the nation-wide benefits of EHR functions.","",10.1186/s12913-020-05767-5,"Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical           data;Health Facility Size/*statistics & numerical data;Hospitals, State/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Surveys and Questionnaires;Turkey",33087106,PMC7580017

Patient portals are used to not only provide access to parts of the health records such as lab results but also offer services such as customized educational materials and appointment scheduling. While prior studies examining the adoption rates of these patient portals have not offered consistent findings, many of the studies have reported limited adoption and use [1] of patient portals, especially among the underserved population. This study explores the factors behind the reduced adoption rate of patient portals among the underserved by focusing on their Patient Web Portal Readiness (PWPR). DESIGN: The study empirically evaluates the impact of three important variables on PWPR among the underserved: (a) Personal Health Information Management (PHIM) activities, (b) patient attitude toward personal health record keeping; and (c) use of Internet for health information seeking. The study also incorporates three other factors: (d) access to Internet; (e) demographics; and (f) presence of chronic illness. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected through a survey from 132 patients from the underserved population who visited 5 free clinics in the Northern Virginia area in the US. The paper-based survey was administered to the patients who visited these free clinics for care. RESULTS: The study findings show support for the hypotheses related to the impact of the two key factors - Personal Health Information Management (PHIM) activities and attitude toward personal health record keeping - on PWPR. The findings also indicate that the use of Internet for health information seeking has relatively more impact than patient's Internet access on PWPR. Overall, the findings imply the critical importance of complementary activities - e.g., PHIM activities, Internet-based health information seeking - to enhance PWPR among the underserved population.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.03.004,"Adolescent;Adult;*Attitude to Computers;Chronic Disease;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Health Information Management/*statistics & numerical data;Health Records, Personal/*psychology;Humans;Internet/*statistics & numerical data;Male;Meaningful Use;Middle Aged;Patient Portals/*statistics & numerical data;Surveys and Questionnaires;Young Adult",28495349,

In this qualitative study, we examine the perspectives of both academic and private physicians and administrators as stakeholders, and their alignment, to explore their perspectives on the use of technology in the clinical environment. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 74 participants who were asked a series of open-ended questions. Grounded theory was used to analyze the transcribed data and build convergent themes. The relevance and importance of themes was constructed by examining frequency, convergence, and intensity. A model was proposed that represents the interactions between themes. RESULTS: Six major themes emerged, which include the impact of EHR systems on workflow, patient care, communication, research/outcomes/billing, education/learning, and institutional culture. Academic and private physicians were confident of the future benefits of EHR systems, yet cautious about the current implementations of EHR, and its impact on interactions with other members of the healthcare team and with patients, and the amount of time necessary to use EHR's. Private physicians differed on education and were uneasy about the steep learning curve necessary for use of new systems. In contrast to physicians, university and hospital administrators are optimistic, and value the availability of data for use in reporting. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that both private and academic physicians concur on the need for features that maintain and enhance the relationship with the patient and the healthcare team. Resistance to adoption is related to insufficient functionality and its potential negative impact on patient care.

Anesthesia care is a significant component of the perioperative period, yet little is known about the adoption of anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) by US anesthesiologists, particularly in non-academic settings. Herein, we report the results of a survey of US anesthesiologists regarding adoption of AIMS and anesthesiologist-perceived advantages and barriers to AIMS adoption. METHODS: Using the e-mail database of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, we solicited randomly selected US anesthesiologists to participate in a survey of their AIMS adoption, perceived advantages and barriers to AIMS. Two and then 3 weeks after the initial mailing, a follow-up e-mail was sent to each anesthesiologist. The study was closed 4 weeks after the initial mailing. RESULTS: Five thousand anesthesiologists were solicited; 615 (12.3%) responses were received. Twenty-four percent of respondents had installed an AIMS, while 13% were either installing a system now or had selected one, and an additional 13% were actively searching. Larger anesthesiology groups with large case loads, urban settings, and government affiliated or academic institutions were more likely to have adopted AIMS. Initial cost was the most frequently cited AIMS barrier. The most commonly cited benefit was more accurate clinical documentation (79%), while unanticipated need for ongoing information technology support (49%) and difficult integration of AIMS with an existing EMR (61%) were the most commonly cited problems. There were no barriers cited significantly more often by non-adopters than adopters. CONCLUSIONS: At least 50% of our survey respondents were currently using, installing, planning to install, or searching for an AIMS. However, the strength of any conclusion is undermined by a low survey response rate and potential bias as respondents using or searching for an AIMS may be more likely to participate. Nonetheless, challenges exist for anesthesiologists considering AIMS adoption including cost. Furthermore, important questions remain regarding payment for anesthesia services and the relationship of AIMS and ""meaningful use"" as defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.","",10.1007/s10877-011-9289-x,"Anesthesiology/*methods;Data Collection;Diffusion of Innovation;Humans;Information Management;*Management Information Systems;Medical Records Systems, Computerized/organization & administration/*statistics &           numerical data;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Surveys and Questionnaires;United States",21728057,

Empowering PHR provides health awareness and intention for health promotion. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present a research framework to examine individuals' intention to PHR use. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the questionnaire to collect data from the individual in Taiwan. Individual's intention to use PHR has been examined by a framework based on extended technology acceptance model (TAM), with gender and health-care technology self-efficacy (HTSE) as external variables. Additionally, gender differences were explored in perceptions and relationships among factors influencing an individual's intention to PHR use. The research framework was evaluated by structural equation modeling (SEM) and represented by Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS). RESULTS: A total of 234 valid responses were used for analysis. The results suggest that the extended TAM model explains 40.6% of the variance of intention to PHR use (R(2) = 0.406). The findings also supported that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward using PHR significantly influenced individual's intention to PHR use. Additionally, results also indicated that women were more strongly influenced by perceptions of HTSE. CONCLUSIONS: The extended TAM model contributes reasonable explanation for interprets and anticipates of individuals' intention to use and adopt PHR. Moreover, the results have provided support for HTSE and gender as significant variables in TAM. However, the study identified three relevant factors directly and one factor indirectly influencing on individuals' intention to PHR use.

The system was introduced to facilitate adherence to clinical practice guidelines and to support decision making during client encounter to bridge the know-do gap of health workers. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe health workers' acceptance and use of the eCDSS for maternal care in rural primary health care (PHC) facilities of Ghana and Tanzania and to identify factors affecting successful adoption of such a system. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in Lindi rural district in Tanzania and Kassena-Nankana district in Ghana between October 2011 and December 2013 employing mixed methods. The study population included healthcare workers who were involved in the provision of maternal care in six rural PHC facilities from one district in each country where the eCDSS was implemented. RESULTS: All eCDSS users participated in the study with 61 and 56 participants at the midterm and final assessment, respectively. After several rounds of user training and support the eCDSS has been successfully adopted and constantly used during patient care in antenatal clinics and maternity wards. The eCDSS was used in 71% (2703/3798) and 59% (14,189/24,204) of all ANC clients in Tanzania and Ghana respectively, while it was also used in 83% (1185/1427) and 67% (1435/2144) of all deliveries in Tanzania and in Ghana, respectively. Several barriers reported to hinder eCDSS use were related to individual users, tasks, technology, and organization attributes. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an eCDSS in resource-constrained PHC facilities in sub-Saharan Africa was successful and the health workers accepted and continuously used the system for maternal care. Facilitators for eCDSS use included sufficient training and regular support whereas the challenges to sustained use were unreliable power supply and perceived high workload. However our study also shows that most of the perceived challenges did not substantially hinder adoption and utilization of the eCDSS during patient care.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.05.002,"Adult;Africa South of the Sahara;*Attitude of Health Personnel;Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards;Female;Health Personnel;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Maternal Health Services/*standards;Pregnancy;Prenatal Care/*standards;Primary Health Care/*standards;Rural Health Services/*organization & administration",26073076,

For this sample of rural veterans, a range of telephone, computer, and Internet technologies may become more important for accessing care as Internet access becomes more ubiquitous and as younger veterans begin using the VA health system. The focus group highlighted the negative impact of distance, economic considerations, geographic barriers, and specific medical conditions on access to care.

However, despite its positive benefits, studies indicate that the rate of the e-health adoption in some developing countries is either low or underutilized. This is due in part, to barriers such as resistance from healthcare professionals, poor infrastructure, and low technical expertise among others. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate, identify and analyze the underlying factors that affect healthcare professionals decision to adopt and use e-health technology applications in developing countries, with particular reference to hospitals in Nigeria. METHODS: The study used a cross sectional approach in the form of a close-ended questionnaire to collect quantitative data from a sample of 465 healthcare professionals randomly selected from 15 hospitals in Nigeria. We used the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the dependent variable and external factors as independent variables. The collected data was then analyzed using SPSS statistical analysis such as frequency test, reliability analysis, and correlation coefficient analysis. RESULTS: The results obtained, which correspond with findings from other researches published, indicate that perceived usefulness, belief, willingness, as well as attitude of healthcare professionals have significant influence on their intention to adopt and use the e-health technology applications. Other strategic factors identified include low literacy level and experience in using the e-health technology applications, lack of motivation, poor organizational and management policies. CONCLUSION: The study contributes to the literature by pinpointing significant areas where findings can positively affect, or be found useful by, healthcare policy decision makers in Nigeria and other developing countries. This can help them understand their areas of priorities and weaknesses when planning for e-health technology adoption and implementation.","",10.7717/peerj.4436,"",29507830,PMC5835346

Furthermore, new diagnostic techniques have been developed to obtain better results in less time, saving costs, and bringing services closer to the most unprotected areas. This paper presents the integration of a top-notch component, such as hardware, software, telecommunications, and medical equipment, to produce a complete system of Electronic Health Record (EHR). The EHR implementation aims to contribute to the expansion of the health services offer concerning people who live in locations where typically have difficult access to medical care. The methodology throughout the work is a Strategic Planning to set priorities, focus energy and resources, strengthen operations, ensure that directors, managers, employees, and other stakeholders are working toward common goals, establish agreement around intended outcomes/results. A medical and technical team is incorporated to complete the tasks of process and requirements analysis, software coding and design, technical support, training, and coaching for EHR system users throughout the implementation process. The adoption of those tools reflect notably some expected results and benefits on patient care. The EHR implementation ensures that information collection does not duplicate already existing information or duplicate effort and maximize the practical use of the data collected. Moreover, the EHR reduces mistakes in hospital readmissions, improves paperwork, promotes the progress of the state's health care system providing emergency, specialty, and primary health care in a rural area of Campeche. The EHR implementation is critical to support decision making and to promote public health. The total number of consults increased markedly from 2012 (14021) to 2019 (34751).

Understanding patients' perspectives on telemedicine is pivotal for its wider adoption in managing non-communicable diseases (NCD) in the community. AIM: This study explores the views and concerns of patients who have yet to use video consultation (VC) for NCD management in Singapore. DESIGN & SETTING: This qualitative study was conducted in a Singapore primary care clinic. METHOD: 16 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or hypertension and/or hyperlipidaemia without prior VC experience participated in individual in-depth interviews in this study. They were purposively enrolled in the polyclinic. Audited transcripts were independently coded by two investigators. Thematic analysis was performed to identify perspectives on telemedicine based on the health, information, and technology zones of the Health Information Technology Acceptance Model (HITAM). RESULTS: Three themes emerged: perceived benefits of VC utility, perceived barriers towards VC adoption, and potential challenges of VC. Participants viewed VC as safe and convenient if they had stable NCD. They voiced concerns on possible suboptimal care due to the absence of physical examination, network connectivity, and personal medical data security. Participants highlighted challenges of VC uptake such as digital health familiarity, availability of their own mobile and telemonitoring devices, and healthcare costs consideration. CONCLUSION: Addressing the concerns and challenges highlighted by non-VC users can help physicians and policy-makers explore ways to scale up telemedicine in Singapore. A hybrid clinical care model comprising in-person visits and VC may be the way forward for NCD management.","",10.3399/BJGPO.2023.0103,"",37591556,

It does this through both the direct intervention of technology to create new diagnostic and treatment opportunities and also through the improved use of information to create more engaging and efficient care processes. OBJECTIVE: In a modern digital hospital, improved clinical and business processes are often driven through enhancing the information flows that support them. To understand an organization's ability to transform their information flows requires a clear understanding of the capabilities of an organization's information technology infrastructure. To date, hospital facilities have been challenged by the absence of uniform ways of describing this infrastructure that would enable them to benchmark where they are and create a vision of where they would like to be. While there is an industry assessment measure for electronic medical record (EMR) adoption using the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics EMR Adoption Model, there is no equivalent for assessing the infrastructure and associated technology capabilities for digital hospitals. Our aim is to fill this gap, as hospital administrators and clinicians need to know how and why to invest in information infrastructure to support health information technology that benefits patient safety and care. METHODS: Based on an operational framework for the Capability Maturity Model, devised specifically for health care, we applied information use characteristics to define eight information systems maturity levels and associated technology infrastructure capabilities. These levels are mapped to user experiences to create a linkage between technology infrastructure and experience outcomes. Subsequently, specific technology capabilities are deconstructed to identify the technology features required to meet each maturity level. RESULTS: The resulting assessment framework clearly defines 164 individual capabilities across the five technology domains and eight maturity levels for hospital infrastructure. These level-dependent capabilities characterize the ability of the hospital's information infrastructure to support the business of digital hospitals including clinical and administrative requirements. Further, it allows the addition of a scoring calculation for each capability, domain, and the overall infrastructure, and it identifies critical requirements to meet each of the maturity levels. CONCLUSIONS: This new Infrastructure Maturity Assessment framework will allow digital hospitals to assess the maturity of their infrastructure in terms of their digital transformation aligning to business outcomes and supporting the desired level of clinical and operational competency. It provides the ability to establish an international benchmark of hospital infrastructure performance, while identifying weaknesses in current infrastructure capability. Further, it provides a business case justification through increased functionality and a roadmap for subsequent digital transformation while moving from one maturity level to the next. As such, this framework will encourage and guide information-driven, digital transformation in health care.","",10.2196/12465,"",30632973,PMC6329893

The present study aimed to investigate the factors affecting hospital information systems nurse-user acceptance of HISs, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), in the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences teaching hospitals. A descriptive-analytical research design was employed to study nurses' adoption and use of HISs. Data collection was undertaken using a cross-sectional survey of nurses (n=303). The research model was examined using the LISREL path confirmatory modeling. The results demonstrated that the nurses' behavioural intention (BI) to use hospital information systems was predicted by Performance Expectancy (PE) (β= 2.34, p<0.01), Effort Expectancy (EE) (β= 2.21, p<0.01), Social Influence (SI) (β= 2.63, p<0.01) and Facilitating Conditions (FC) (β= 2.84, p<0.01). The effects of these antecedents of BI explained 72.8% of the variance in nurses' intention to use hospital information systems (R2 = 0.728). Application of the research model suggested that nurses' acceptance of HISs was influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions, with performance expectancy having the strongest effect on user intention.","",10.1177/183335831404300303,"Adult;*Attitude of Health Personnel;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronic Health Records/*standards;Female;Hospital Information Systems/*standards;Hospitals, Teaching;Humans;Iran;Male;*Nursing Staff, Hospital;Surveys and Questionnaires",27009793,

The authors examine the extent to which the MU program impacted the EHR adoption curve that existed prior to the Act. METHODS: Bass and Gamma Shifted Gompertz (G/SG) diffusion models of the adoption of ""Any"" and ""Basic"" EHR systems in physicians' offices using consistent data series covering 2001-2013 and 2006-2013, respectively, are estimated to determine if adoption was stimulated during either a PrePay (2009-2010) period of subsidy anticipation or a PostPay (2011-2013) period when payments were actually made. RESULTS: Adoption of Any EHR system may have increased by as much as 7 percentage points above the level predicted in the absence of the MU subsidies. This estimate, however, lacks statistical significance and becomes smaller or negative under alternative model specifications. No substantial effects are found for Basic systems. The models suggest that adoption was largely driven by ""imitation"" effects (q-coefficient) as physicians mimic their peers' technology use or respond to mandates. Small and often insignificant ""innovation"" effects (p-coefficient) are found suggesting little enthusiasm by physicians who are leaders in technology adoption. CONCLUSION: The authors find weak evidence of the impact of the MU program on EHR uptake. This is consistent with reports that many current EHR systems reduce physician productivity, lack data sharing capabilities, and need to incorporate other key interoperability features (e.g., application program interfaces).","",10.1093/jamia/ocv103,*American Recovery and Reinvestment Act;Diffusion of Innovation;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;*Meaningful Use;*Physicians;United States,26228764,PMC7784315

To achieve the improvements envisioned in these reports, it is necessary to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the clinical decision support that is delivered to clinicians through electronic health records at the point of care. To make these dramatic improvements will require significant changes to the way in which clinical practice guidelines are developed, incorporated into existing electronic health records (EHR), and integrated into clinicians' workflow at the point of care. In this paper, we: 1) discuss the challenges associated with translating evidence to practice; 2) consider what it will take to bridge the gap between the current limits to use of CPGs and expectations for their meaningful use at the point of care in practices with EHRs; 3) describe a framework that underlies CDS systems which, if incorporated in the development of CPGs, can be a means to bridge this gap, 4) review the general types and adoption of current CDS systems, and 5) describe how the adoption of EHRs and related technologies will directly influence the content and form of CPGs. Achieving these objectives should result in improvements in the quality and reductions in the cost of healthcare, both of which are necessary to ensure a 21st century delivery system that consistently provides safe and effective care to all patients.","",10.1186/1472-6947-13-47,*Computer Systems;*Evidence-Based Practice;Humans,23587225,PMC3639800

This should be evaluated through the awareness and readiness of healthcare workers to adopt E-Health technology to reduce health information technology failures. METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between the perceived attributes of innovation and E-Health adoption decisions of healthcare workers as part of a preimplementation process. Using a cross-sectional quantitative approach, the dimensions of the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory were used to assess the E-Health readiness of 110 healthcare workers in a Mauritian specialized hospital. RESULTS: A strong inclination towards E-Health adoption was observed, where the prime stimulators were perceived as modernization of healthcare management (84.1%, ẋ=4.19), increased work efficiency through reduction of duplication (77.6%, ẋ=4.10) and faster generation of results (71.1%, ẋ=4.07). The findings of this study also validated the use of five DOI dimensions (i.e. relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability) in a predictability model (F(5, 101)=17.067, p<0.001) towards E-Health adoption. A significant association between 'adopter category' and 'willingness to recommend E-Health adoption' (χ2(8)=74.89, p<0.001) endorsed the fact that physicians and nursing managers have central roles within a social ecosystem to facilitate the diffusion of technology and influence the adoption of innovation. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of its kind in Mauritius to successfully characterize each adopter's profile and demonstrate the applicability of the DOI framework to predict the diffusion rate of E-Health platforms, while also highlighting the importance of identifying key opinion leaders who can be primed by innovators regarding the benefits of E-Health platforms, thus ensuring non-disruptive evolutionary innovation in the Mauritian healthcare sector.","",10.1093/inthealth/ihab035,Cross-Sectional Studies;Delivery of Health Care;Diffusion of Innovation;*Ecosystem;Humans;*Telemedicine,34114007,PMC9070468

Increased adoption of Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs) in recent years by EHR systems has increased the availability of patient data for external applications such as REDCap. OBJECTIVE: Describe the development of the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module that provides seamless data exchange between the REDCap research EDC and any EHR system with a FHIR API. CDIS enables end users to independently set up their data collection projects, map EHR data to fields, and adjudicate data transfer without project-by-project involvement from Health Information Technology staff. METHODS: We identified two use cases for EHR data transfer into REDCap. Clinical Data Pull (CDP) automatically pulls EHR data into user-defined REDCap fields and replaces the workflow of having to transcribe or copy and paste data from the EHR. Clinical Data Mart (CDM) collects all specified data for a patient over a given time period and replaces the process of importing EHR data for registries from research databases. With an iterative process, we designed our access control, authentication, variable selection, and mapping interfaces in such a way that end users could easily set up and use CDIS. RESULTS: Since its release, the REDCap CDIS has been used to pull over 19.5 million data points for 82 projects at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Software and documentation are available through the REDCap Consortium. CONCLUSIONS: The new REDCap Clinical Data and Interoperability Services (CDIS) module leverages the FHIR standard to enable real-time and direct data extraction from the EHR. Researchers can self-service the mapping and adjudication of EHR data into REDCap. The uptake of CDIS at VUMC and other REDCap consortium sites is improving the accuracy and efficiency of EHR data collection by reducing the need for manual transcription and flat file uploads.","",10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103871,Data Warehousing;Delivery of Health Care;*Electronic Health Records;*Health Level Seven;Humans;Workflow,34298155,PMC9217161

With increased adoption of commercial electronic medical records (EMR), some institutions have used unidirectional links to send immunization data to designated registries. However, access to these registries within a vendor EMR has not been previously reported. PURPOSE: To develop a visually integrated interface between an EMR and a statewide immunization registry at a previously non-reporting hospital, and to assess subsequent changes in provider use and satisfaction. METHODS: A group of healthcare providers were surveyed before and after implementation of the new interface. The surveys addressed access of the California Immunization Registry (CAIR), and satisfaction with the availability of immunization information. Information Technology (IT) teams developed a ""smart-link"" within the electronic patient chart that provides a single-click interface for visual integration of data within the CAIR database. RESULTS: Use of the tool has increased in the months since its initiation, and over 20,000 new immunizations have been exported successfully to CAIR since the hospital began sharing data with the registry. Survey data suggest that providers find this tool improves workflow and overall satisfaction with availability of immunization data. (p=0.009).

MATERIALS & METHODS: Observational study that follows initial PCD Tool scaling across primary care at a Midwestern academic health network. Program invitations, enrollment, patient submissions, and clinician views were tracked over a 1-year study period. Logistic regression modeled the likelihood of using the PCD Tool, accounting for patient covariates. RESULTS: Of 58,874 patients who could be contacted by email, 9,183 (15.6%) became PCD Tool users. Overall, 76% of primary care providers had patients who used the PCD Tool. Older age, female gender, non-minority race, patient portal activation, and Medicare coverage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of use. Number of office visits, medical issues, and behavioral health conditions also associated with use. Primary care staff viewed 18.7% of available PCD Tool summaries, 1.1% to 57.6% per clinic. DISCUSSION: The intervention mainly reached non-minority patients and patients who used more health services. Given the requirement for an email address on file, some patients may have been underrepresented. Overall, patient reach and adoption and clinician adoption, implementation, and maintenance of this Tool were modest but stable, consistent with a non-directive approach to fostering adoption by introducing the Tool in the absence of clear expectations for use. CONCLUSION: Healthcare organizations must implement effective methods to increase the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of PCD tools across all patient populations. Assisting people, particularly racial minorities, with PCD Tool registration and actively supporting clinician use are critical steps in implementing technology that facilitates care.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104810,Aged;*Electronic Health Records;Female;Humans;Informatics;*Medicare;Research Design;United States,35714549,

There is significant variation in the use of EHR functionalities across the LTC facilities in Texas. In the LTC facilities, the administrative functions of EHRs have been more widely adopted and are more widely utilized than the clinical functions of EHRs. Among the clinical functions adopted, the resident assessment, physician orders, care management plan, and census management are the leading functions used by the LTC facilities in Texas. Lack of capital resources is still the greatest barrier to EHR adoption and implementation.

The ""Meaningful Use"" (MU) program is designed to increase hospitals' adoption of EHR, which will lead to better care quality, reduce medical errors, avoid unnecessary cost, and promote a patient safety culture. To reduce medical errors, hospital leaders have been encouraged to promote safety cultures common to high-reliability organizations. Expecting a positive relationship between EHR adoption and improved patient safety cultures appears sound in theory, but it has yet to be empirically demonstrated. Design/methodology/approach - Providers' perceptions of patient safety culture and counts of patient safety incidents are explored in relationship to hospital EHR adoption patterns. Multi-level modeling is employed to data drawn from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's surveys on patient safety culture (level 1) and the American Hospital Association's survey and healthcare information technology supplement (level 2). Findings - The findings suggest that the early adoption of EHR capabilities hold a negative association to the number of patient safety events reported. However, this relationship was not present in providers' perceptions of overall patient safety cultures. These mixed results suggest that the understanding of the EHR-patient safety culture relationship needs further research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had 2 phases. The purpose of phase I was to develop a preliminary nursing home IT maturity model. Phase II involved 3 rounds of questionnaires administered to a Delphi panel of expert nursing home administrators to evaluate the validity of the nursing home IT maturity model proposed in phase I. RESULTS: All participants (n = 31) completed Delphi rounds 1-3. Over the 3 Delphi rounds, the nursing home IT maturity staging model evolved from a preliminary, 5-stage model (stages 1-5) to a 7-stage model (stages 0-6). DISCUSSION: Using innovative IT to improve patient outcomes has become a broad goal across healthcare settings, including nursing homes. Understanding the relationship between IT sophistication and quality performance in nursing homes relies on recognizing the spectrum of nursing home IT maturity that exists and how IT matures over time. Currently, no universally accepted nursing home IT maturity model exists to trend IT adoption and determine the impact of increasing IT maturity on quality. CONCLUSIONS: A 7-stage nursing home IT maturity staging model was successfully developed with input from a nationally representative sample of U.S. based nursing home experts. The model incorporates 7-stages of IT maturity ranging from stage 0 (nonexistent IT solutions or electronic medical record) to stage 6 (use of data by resident or resident representative to generate clinical data and drive self-management).","",10.1093/jamia/ocz006,Consensus;Delphi Technique;*Information Technology;*Medical Informatics;*Nursing Homes/organization & administration;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States,30889245,PMC7647342

To address these deficiencies, we present a conceptual framework for measuring HIT value and we propose a checklist of characteristics that should be considered in HIT evaluation studies. The framework consists of 3 key principles: 1) value includes both costs and benefits; 2) value accrues over time; and 3) value depends on which stakeholder's perspective is used. Through examples, we show how these principles can be used to guide and improve HIT evaluation studies. The checklist includes a list of contextual and implementation characteristics that are important for interpretation of results.

OBJECTIVE: This study reviewed progress in the use and adoption of telemedicine in Middle Eastern countries. The key dimensions affecting the progress of telemedicine in these countries were identified. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted on 43 peer reviewed articles from 2010 to 2020. The review followed the scientific process of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines of identification, selection, assessment, synthesis, and interpretation of findings. RESULTS: The results showed that progress made in the utilization of telemedicine was insufficient and varies across Middle Eastern countries. Certain cultural, financial, organizational, individual, technological, legal, and regulatory challenges were found to prevent telemedicine from being fully used to the point where the full range of medical services can be provided. For example, doctor and patient resistance, poor infrastructure, lack of funding, poor system quality, and lack of information technology training were associated with the low adoption of telemedicine in the region. CONCLUSION: This review provides a number of recommendations that will help policymakers to move toward the integration of innovative technologies in order to facilitate access to health information, health services, and training. It also recommends that health initiatives should focus on health education and health promotion in order to increase public awareness of the benefits of telemedicine services in the region.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104232,Health Promotion;Humans;Middle East;Policy;*Telemedicine,32707430,

The authors examine two IT applications, computerised physician order entry (CPOE) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) at the meso and micro levels, within the context of the National Programme for IT in the English National Health Service (NHS). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: To analyse these multi-level dynamics, the authors blend Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory (DoIT) with Webster's sociological critique of technological innovation in medicine and healthcare systems to illuminate a wider range of interacting factors. Qualitative data collected between 2004 and 2006 uses semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 72 stakeholders across four English NHS hospital trusts. FINDINGS: Overall, PACS was more successfully implemented (fully or partially in three out of four trusts) than CPOE (implemented in one trust only). Factors such as perceived benefit to users and attributes of the application - in particular speed, ease of use, reliability and flexibility and levels of readiness - were highly relevant but their influence was modulated through interaction with complex structural and relational issues. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results reveal that combining contextual system level theories with DoIT increases understanding of real-life processes underpinning implementation of IT innovations within healthcare. They also highlight important drivers affecting success of implementation, including socio-political factors, the social body of practice and degree of ""co-construction"" between designers and end-users.

Results suggested that physician and nurse satisfaction is determined differently according to post-adoption expectations: compatibility, confirmation of expectations, usefulness, ease of use, and support. The best predictor of physician satisfaction was perceived usefulness (r=.25, p=.0003) whereas for nurses it was ease of use (r=.18, p=.0003). Confirmation of expectations was strongly associated with each post-adoption expectation and positions its importance in CIS design and redesign.

In view of the global preventive measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further accentuated the necessity for telemedicine and teleradiology. In a country as densely populated as India wherein radiology services are often fragmented, teleradiology can prove to be a lifesaving technology and aid dampen the repercussions stemming from the highly skewed doctor to patient ratio. Although innovative, the effective adoption of teleradiology faces several obstacles in India, such as inadequate technological infrastructure, a lack of knowledge among most medical practitioners, urban-rural disparities and a lack of financing. Similar challenges continue to also be faced by several other developing countries across the globe. This article therefore aims to elaborate on the most important facets of implementation of teleradiology observed in the Indian context to help provide salient pointers for the readership of relevant jurisdictions who may be embracing comparable teleradiology challenges. Despite the hurdles, the future of teleradiology seems promising. The respective governments, policymakers and all relevant stakeholders must continue to take decisive action to ensure that this potential is fully exploited by allocation of necessary funds, strengthening of information technology and its related fields, involvement of human resources with adequate technical and administrative expertise as well as taking continued action to improve existing telemedicine and teleradiology services.","",10.1093/heapol/czac045,*COVID-19/epidemiology;Humans;Pandemics/prevention & control;Physical Distancing;*Telemedicine;*Teleradiology,35699565,PMC9214175

This study examined the TMH adoption rates and associations with facility- and state-level factors among US mental health (MH) facilities. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study used linked data for 2016 from the National Mental Health Services Survey (N = 11,833), Area Health Resources File, and national reports for broadband access and telehealth policies. The associations of facility and state-level characteristics with TMH adoption were examined with multi-level logistic regressions. RESULTS: Overall, 25.9% had used TMH. Having veteran affiliation [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 18.53, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 10.66-32.21] and greater Information Technology (IT) capacity [AOR(95%CI): 2.89(2.10-3.98)] were the strongest correlates of TMH adoption. Other facility characteristics associated with higher likelihood of TMH adoption were: public ownership, high patient volumes, having comprehensive MH treatments or Quality Improvement practices, having private or non-Medicaid public payers, and treating elderly patients (AORs: 1.16-2.41). TMH adoption was less likely among facilities treating more African Americans or patients with substance abuse disorders. TMH adoption varied substantially across states, with adoption more likely in states issuing special telehealth licences and those with more rural counties. DISCUSSION: One in four MH facilities adopted TMH in 2016. TMH adoption varied by multiple facility- and state-level factors. Our findings suggest that: legal/regulatory burden and lower facility IT capacity may discourage TMH adoption; significant racial disparities exist in TMH adoption; and there is a need to increase TMH use for substance abuse disorders.","",10.1177/1357633X19868902,Aged;Cross-Sectional Studies;Health Facilities;Humans;*Mental Health Services;Retrospective Studies;*Telemedicine;United States,31475879,PMC7203624

This chapter explores the journey that a growing number of organizations are taking to become health literate. Health literacy improvement has increasingly been viewed as a systems issue, one that moves beyond siloed efforts by recognizing that action is required on multiple levels. To help operationalize the shift to a systems perspective, members of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine Roundtable on Health Literacy defined ten attributes of health literate health care organizations. External factors, such as payment reform in the U.S., have buoyed health literacy as an organizational priority. Health care organizations often begin their journey to become health literate by conducting health literacy organizational assessments, focusing on written and spoken communication, and addressing difficulties in navigating facilities and complex systems. As organizations' efforts mature, health literacy quality improvement efforts give way to transformational activities. These include: the highest levels of the organization embracing health literacy, making strategic plans for initiating and spreading health literate practices, establishing a health literacy workforce and supporting structures, raising health literacy awareness and training staff system-wide, expanding patient and family input, establishing policies, leveraging information technology, monitoring policy compliance, addressing population health, and shifting the culture of the organization. The penultimate section of this chapter highlights the experiences of three organizations that have explicitly set a goal to become health literate: Carolinas Healthcare System (CHS), Intermountain Healthcare, and Northwell Health. These organizations are pioneers that approached health literacy in a systematic fashion, each exemplifying different routes an organization can take to become health literate. CHS provides an example of how, even when the most senior leadership drives the organization to become health literate, continued progress requires constant reinvigoration. At Intermountain Healthcare, the push to become a health literate organization was the natural consequence of organizational adoption of a model of shared accountability that necessitated patient engagement for its success. Northwell Health, on the other hand, provides a model of how a persistent champion can elevate health literacy to become a system priority and how system-wide policies and procedures can advance effective communication across language differences, health literacy, and cultures. The profiles of the three systems make clear that the opportunities for health literacy improvement are vast. Success depends on the presence of a perfect storm of conditions conducive to transformational change. This chapter ends with lessons learned from the experiences of health literacy pioneers that may be useful to organizations embarking on the journey. The journey is long, and there are bumps along the road. Nonetheless, discernable progress has been made. While committed to transformation, organizations seeking to be health literate recognize that it is not a destination you can ever reach. A health literate organization is constantly striving, always knowing that further improvement can be made.","",,"*Delivery of Health Care;*Health Literacy;Humans;*Leadership;Quality Assurance, Health Care",28972519,PMC5666686

DESIGN: Descriptive and interpretive qualitative analysis of transcripts and field notes from focus groups of the IPHR users and of patients who were invited but did not use the IPHR (non-users). Grounded theory techniques were then applied via an editing approach for key emergent themes. SETTING: Primary care patients in eight practices of the Virginia Ambulatory Care Outcomes Research Network (ACORN). PARTICIPANTS: Three focus groups involved a total of 14 IPHR users and two groups of non-users totalled 14 participants. OUTCOMES/RESULTS: For themes identified (relevance, trust and functionality) participants indicated that endorsement and use of the IPHR by their personal clinician was vital. In particular, participants' comments linked the IPHR use to: (1) integrating the IPHR into current care, (2) promoting effective patient-clinician encounters and communication and (3) their confidence in the accuracy, security and privacy of the information. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to patients' stated desires for advanced functionality and information accuracy and privacy, successful adoption of the IPHRs by primary care patients depends on such technology's relevance, and on its promotion via integration with primary care practices' processes and the patient-clinician relationship. Accordingly, models of technological success and adoption, when applied to primary care, may need to include the patient-clinician relationship and practice workflow.

PHRs can be tethered to a patient's electronic health record (EHR). Tethered PHRs, also known as patient portals, allow patients to access relevant medical information from their provider. Despite recent policy efforts to promote the use of health information technology and increased availability of PHRs in the clinical setting, PHR adoption rates remain relatively low overall. This article examines physician characteristics of high vs. low PHR adopters. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine PHR use patterns in the primary care setting, (2) identify physician characteristics affecting PHR adoption, and (3) explore physician perspectives encouraging and deterring use. METHODS: Information technology records provided data on primary care patient portal use at a large Midwestern academic medical center. Electronic surveys were administered to affiliated primary care physicians to measure their perceived use of patient portals. A focus group consisting of physician providers who completed the survey was used to further elucidate the trends and perceived utilization of the patient portal in the clinical setting. RESULTS: While they expended significant time communicating with patients using the portal, physicians generally overestimated the time spent per week on the system. Physicians who had been in practice longer estimated a higher average time spent on the system when compared to newer physicians. Patient portal activation rates and use decreased with increased years in practice. During the focus groups, physicians voiced motivation to use patient portals because they perceived improved patient communication and satisfaction with use. However, continued lack of reimbursement for time spent in portal communication was reported as a major barrier to providers' engagement with this technology. DISCUSSION: Physician endorsement and engagement is critical to achieve widespread adoption of PHRs. Such endorsement can be obtained through (1) providing rewards from health system employers for high use of PHRs, (2) providing financial reimbursement for time spent electronically communicating with patients via the PHR from federal initiatives incentivizing meaningful use of health information technology, (3) building robust support staff assistance for PHR communication into primary care workflows, and (4) integrating more PHR-specific education into providers' EHR training.","",,"Adult;Aged;Communication;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Focus Groups;Humans;Inservice Training;Insurance, Health, Reimbursement;Male;Middle Aged;*Patient Access to Records;Patient Satisfaction;Physician-Patient Relations;Physicians/*statistics & numerical data;Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data;Primary Health Care/*organization & administration;Time Factors;Young Adult",26755897,PMC4696089

We aimed to describe trends in e-visit adoption among the U.S. office-based physicians and examine physician-and practice-level factors associated with e-visit adoption. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of 2011-2015 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We used the Cochran-Armitage tests to evaluate trend changes in e-visit adoption among the U.S. office-based physicians. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of adopting e-visits adjusting for physician and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Our sample included 10,767 respondents, representing 327,836 office-based physicians in the U.S. Our analysis indicated that, in 2015, 15.9% of physicians adopted e-visits, which is a minor increase of 2.2% in total utilization of 13.7% in 2011. The likelihood of adopting e-visits was 2.7 times higher for physicians who have fully implemented electronic health records systems compared (odds ratio, 2.66, [95% CI, 2.16-3.28]) to physicians who have not implemented EHRs.

Global references demonstrate that information technology has the ability to assist in this regard through the automation of processes, thus reducing the inefficiencies of manually driven processes and lowering transaction costs. This study examines the impact of hospital information systems implementation on service delivery, user adoption and organisational culture within two hospital settings in South Africa. METHODS: Ninety-four interviews with doctors, nurses and hospital administrators were conducted in two public sector tertiary healthcare facilities (in two provinces) to record end-user perceptions. Structured questionnaires were used to conduct the interviews with both qualitative and quantitative information. RESULTS: Noteworthy differences were observed among the three sample groups of doctors, nurses and administrators as well as between our two hospital groups. The impact of automation in terms of cost and strategic value in public sector hospitals is shown to have yielded positive outcomes with regard to patient experience, hospital staff workflow enhancements, and overall morale in the workplace. CONCLUSION: The research provides insight into the reasons for investing in system automation, the associated outcomes, and organisational factors that impact the successful adoption of IT systems. In addition, it finds that sustainable success in these initiatives is as much a function of the technology as it is of the change management function that must accompany the system implementation.","",10.1186/1472-6947-13-13,"Attitude to Computers;Cost-Benefit Analysis;*Diffusion of Innovation;Efficiency, Organizational;*Health Facilities;Health Services Research;Hospital Information Systems/*organization & administration/statistics &           numerical data;Humans;Interviews as Topic;Medical Staff, Hospital/psychology/statistics & numerical data;Organizational Case Studies;Organizational Culture;*Public Sector;South Africa;Surveys and Questionnaires",23347433,PMC3570341

Healthcare quality organizations are increasingly recognizing the role of health information technology in improving care, multi-site CDS demonstration projects are under way, and there are growing incentives for adoption. Specific recommendations include: (1) designating a national entity to coordinate CDS work and collaboration; (2) developing approaches to monitor and track CDS adoption and use; (3) defining and funding a CDS research agenda; and (4) updating the CDS 'critical path'.","",10.1136/jamia.2010.005561,"Cooperative Behavior;Decision Making, Computer-Assisted;*Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Diffusion of Innovation;Medical Informatics/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration;United States",20819850,PMC2995690

The American Medical Informatics Association's 2010 Health Policy Conference was convened to further the national discourse on the issues surrounding these longer-term considerations. Conference participants self-selected into three broad categories: resilience in healthcare and health IT; ethical, legal, and social challenges; and innovation, adoption, and sustainability. The discussions about problem areas lead to findings focusing on the lack of encouragement for long-term IT innovation that may result from current health IT policies; the potential impact of uneven adoption of health IT based on the exclusions of the current financial incentives; the weaknesses of contingency and risk mitigation planning that threaten system resilience; and evolving standards developed in response to challenges relating to the security, integrity, and availability of electronic health information. This paper discusses these findings and also offers recommendations that address the interwoven topics of innovation, resilience, and adoption. The goal of this paper is to encourage public and private sector organizations that have a role in shaping health information policy to increase attention to developing a national strategy that assures that health IT innovation and resilience are not impeded by shorter-term efforts to implement current approaches emphasizing adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records.","",10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000522,"*Diffusion of Innovation;Health Plan Implementation/*organization & administration;*Health Policy;Humans;Medical Informatics/*organization & administration;Organizational Innovation;Societies, Scientific;United States",22037887,PMC3341794

We use real-world safety examples and outline a comprehensive shared responsibility approach to help guide development of future rules, regulations, and standards for EHR usability, interoperability and security as outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act. This approach clearly defines the responsibilities of each party and helps create appropriate measures for success. National and international policymakers must facilitate the local organizational and socio-political climate to stimulate the adoption of shared responsibility principles.

However, evidence concerning the effectiveness of the technology is limited hindering the wide adoption of a HIE. The objective of this study was to assess impacts of a HIE on healthcare utilization and costs of patient episodes at a tertiary care hospital following referrals by clinic physicians. MATERIAL/METHODS: We studied 1265 HIE and 2702 non-HIE episodes after physicians referred patients from 35 HIE and 59 non-HIE clinics to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) during a 17-month period from June 2009. We examined 9 measures of healthcare utilization and the magnitude of clinical information exchanged in 4 categories. We estimated the savings resulting from HIE use through linear regression models with dummy variables for HIE participation and patient classification codes controlling the case-mix differences between HIE and non-HIE cases. RESULTS: The total charges incurred by the HIE group during episodes at SNUBH were approximately 13% lower (P<0.001), and the charges for clinical laboratory tests, pathological diagnosis, function tests, and diagnostic imaging were 54% (P<0.001), 76% (P<0.001), 73% (P<0.001), and 80% (P<0.001) lower for the HIE group than for the non-HIE group. SNUBH physicians had access to more clinical information for HIE than for non-HIE patients. CONCLUSIONS: HIE technology improved physicians' access to past clinical information, which appeared to reduce diagnostic test utilization and healthcare costs. The payer was the major beneficiary of HIE cost savings whereas providers paid for the technology.

Published reports suggest that important principles include consistency of design concepts across networked systems, use of appropriate visual representation of clinical data, use of controlled terminology, presenting advice at the time and place of decision making and matching the most appropriate CDS interventions to clinical goals. Specificity and contextual relevance can be increased by periodic review of trigger rules, analysis of performance logs and maintenance of accurate allergy, problem and medication lists in health records in order to help avoid excessive alerting. Developers need to adopt design practices that include user-centered, iterative design and common standards based on human-computer interaction (HCI) research methods rooted in ethnography and cognitive science.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems.","",10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138,"Adult;Biological Ontologies;Computer Simulation;*Electronic Health Records;*Health Information Interoperability;*Health Records, Personal;Humans;Natural Language Processing;Semantics",29993759,

A promising TB-SA, the VA eScreening program, has shown promise for the efficient and effective collection of mental and physical health information. To assist adoption of eScreening by healthcare providers, we assessed technology-related as well as individual- and system-level factors that might influence the implementation of eScreening in four diverse VA clinics. METHODS: This was a mixed-method, pre-post, quasi-experimental study originally designed as a quality improvement project. The clinics were selected to represent a range of environments that could potentially benefit from TB-SA and that made use of the variety eScreening functions. Because of limited resources, the implementation strategy consisted of staff education, training, and technical support as needed. Data was collected using pre- and post-implementation interviews or focus groups of leadership and clinical staff, eScreening usage data, and post-implementation surveys. Data was gathered on: 1) usability of eScreening; 2) knowledge about and acceptability and 3) facilitators and barriers to the successful implementation of eScreening. RESULTS: Overall, staff feedback about eScreening was positive. Knowledge about eScreening ranged widely between the clinics. Nearly all staff felt eScreening would fit well into their clinical setting at pre-implementation; however some felt it was a poor fit with emergent cases and older adults at post-implementation. Lack of adequate personnel support and perceived leadership support were barriers to implementation. Adequate training and technical assistance were cited as important facilitators. One clinic fully implemented eScreening, two partially implemented, and one clinic did not implement eScreening as part of normal practice after 6 months as measured by usage data and self-report. Organizational engagement survey scores were higher among clinics with full or partial implementation and low in the clinic that did not implement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some added work load for some staff and perceived lack of leadership support, eScreening was at least partially implemented in three clinics. The technology itself posed no barriers in any of the settings. An implementation strategy that accounts for increased work burden and includes accountability may help in future eScreening implementation efforts. Note.

Interestingly, 89.2% of them have two or more smart devices. Participants have average knowledge about telemedicine technology (46.1%). Nearly, 77% of the professionals believed that continuous training is necessary for the use of telemedicine (P = 0.01). The highest level of perception was (90%) for telemedicine as a viable approach for providing medical care services to patients. More than 90% of specialties professional agreed that telemedicine can save time, money and further believed information and communication technology (ICT) has a potential role in healthcare. Overall, 70% of physicians reported a very low number of conferences, speeches or meetings held regarding telemedicine technology in their working places. Main issues reported in adopting telemedicine are patient privacy, the high cost of equipment, lack of suitable training, and lack of consultation between information technology expert and clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that the majority of professionals have two or more smart devices and are communicating with patients via email or social media. However, the majority of medical professionals still have low knowledge of telemedicine technology. In addition, most of the participants showed positive perceptions of telemedicine and are willing to adopt it in clinical practice. The major reported barriers for the adoption of telemedicine were privacy issues, lack of training, cost and issues related to information and communication technology.","",10.1016/j.jiph.2019.04.006,Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Perception;*Physicians;Saudi Arabia;Surveys and Questionnaires;*Telemedicine,31060975,

With poor system usability comes increased risk of negative unintended consequences. Usability issues could lead to user error and workarounds that have the potential to compromise patient safety and negatively impact the quality of care.[1] While there is ample research on EHR usability, there is little information on the usability of laboratory information systems (LISs). Yet, LISs facilitate the timely provision of a great deal of the information needed by physicians to make patient care decisions.[2] Medical and technical advances in genomics that require processing of an increased volume of complex laboratory data further underscore the importance of developing user-friendly LISs. This study aims to add to the body of knowledge on LIS usability. METHODS: A survey was distributed among LIS users at hospitals across the United States. The survey consisted of the ten-item System Usability Scale (SUS). In addition, participants were asked to rate the ease of performing 24 common tasks with a LIS. Finally, respondents provided comments on what they liked and disliked about using the LIS to provide diagnostic insight into LIS perceived usability. RESULTS: The overall mean SUS score of 59.7 for the LIS evaluated is significantly lower than the benchmark of 68 (P < 0.001). All LISs evaluated received mean SUS scores below 68 except for Orchard Harvest (78.7). While the years of experience using the LIS was found to be a statistically significant influence on mean SUS scores, the combined effect of years of experience and LIS used did not account for the statistically significant difference in the mean SUS score between Orchard Harvest and each of the other LISs evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that overall usability of LISs is poor. Usability lags that of systems evaluated across 446 usability surveys.","",10.4103/jpi.jpi_24_17,"",29114434,PMC5653961

Designed for supporting the peculiarities of radiological diagnostic workflows, Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) developed into widely used information systems in hospitals and form the basis for advancing the field towards automated image diagnostics. RIS and PACS can thus serve as meaningful indicators of how quickly IT innovations diffuse in secondary care settings - an issue that requires increased attention in research and health policy in the light of increasingly fast innovation cycles. We therefore conducted a retrospective longitudinal observational study to research the diffusion dynamics of RIS and PACS in German hospitals between 2005 and 2017. Based upon data points collected within the ""IT Report Healthcare"" and building on Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, we applied a novel methodological technique by fitting Bayesian Bass Diffusion Models on past adoption rates. The Bass models showed acceptable goodness of fit to the data and the results indicated similar growth rates of RIS and PACS implementations and suggest that market saturation is almost reached. Adoption rates of PACS showed a slightly higher coefficient of imitation (q = 0.25) compared to RIS (q = 0.11). However, the diffusion process expands over approximately two decades for both systems which points at the need for further research into how innovation diffusion can be accelerated effectively. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach to Bass modelling showed to have several advantages over the classical frequentists approaches and should encourage adoption and diffusion research to adapt similar techniques.","",10.3233/SHTI190799,*Bayes Theorem;Hospitals;*Radiology;*Radiology Information Systems;Retrospective Studies,31483249,

Furthermore, our system designers have failed to respond to the expansion of the use of the medical record from its origin as simply the physician's memory and communication tool to becoming the building block for our Medical Record Health Information System (MRHIS), where it also supplies the justification for payment for care and is the source of fundamental statistics about health and healthcare. These problems reflect a basic flaw in the application of available information technology to EMR design and data management: We use output codes--the category codes from ICD-9-CM--for input of diagnoses. This fact imposes the tyranny. Our medical record must have these ICD-9-CM codes for the reimbursement system. But, to be accepted as the basic record for medical care, and at the same time, to be truly useful for case retrieval and statistics, medical informatics experts recognize that our EMR must have codes for the exact diagnoses of the patient (diagnosis entities).

One promising approach to addressing disparities is shared decision making (SDM), a method by which the patient and provider cooperatively make a decision about asthma care. SDM is associated with improved outcomes for patients; however, time constraints and staff availability are noted implementation barriers. Use of health information technology (IT) solutions may facilitate the utilization of SDM. Coach McLungs(SM) is a collaborative web-based application that involves pediatric patients, their caregivers, and providers in a personalized experience while gathering patient-reported data. Background logic provides decision support so both audiences can develop a well-informed treatment plan together. The goal of this study is to evaluate the implementation of the Coach McLungs(SM) intervention into primary care. METHODS: Implementation will be evaluated using a stepped wedge randomized control study design at 21 pediatric and family medicine practices within a large, integrated, nonprofit healthcare system. We will measure changes in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and oral steroid use, which serve as surrogate measures for patient-centered asthma outcomes. We will use a generalized linear mixed models with logit link to test the hypothesis for the reduction in exacerbation rates specifying the fixed effects of intervention and time and random effects for practice and practice*time. This design achieves 84% power to detect the hypothesized effect size difference of 10% in overall exacerbation between control (40%) and intervention (30%) periods (two-sided, p = 0.05). Implementation will be guided using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC), a compilation of implementation strategies, and evaluated using the CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) and RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). DISCUSSION: We anticipate that a tailored implementation of Coach McLungs(SM) across diverse primary care practices will lead to a decrease in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and oral steroid use for patients in the intervention group as compared to the control condition.

Theoretically, health IT could lower hospitals' malpractice insurance premiums (MIPs) and improve the quality of care by reducing the number and size of malpractice. This study examines the relationship between health IT investment and MIP using California hospital data from 2006 to 2007. METHODS: To examine the effect of hospital IT on malpractice insurance expense, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) was employed. RESULTS: It was found that health IT investment was not negatively associated with MIP. Health IT was reported to reduce medical error and improve efficiency. Thus, it may reduce malpractice claims from patients, which will reduce malpractice insurance expenses for hospitals. However, health IT adoption could lead to increases in MIPs. For example, we expect increases in MIPs of about 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, when health IT and labor increase by 10%. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the effect of health IT investment on MIPs controlling other hospital and market, and volume characteristics. Against our expectation, we found that health IT investment was not negatively associated with MIP. There may be some possible reasons that the real effect of health IT on MIPs was not observed; barriers including communication problems among health ITs, shorter sample period, lower IT investment, and lack of a quality of care measure as a moderating variable.","",10.4258/hir.2015.21.2.118,"",25995964,PMC4434060

Policy makers in the United States and Germany follow this logic and deploy nationwide HIT adoption programs to fund hospital investments in digital technologies. However, scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of HIT on care quality at a national level remains mostly US based, is focused on electronic health records (EHRs), and rarely accounts for the quality of digitization from a hospital user perspective. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of digitization on clinical outcomes and patient experience in German hospitals. Hence, this study adds to the small stream of literature in this field outside the United States. It goes beyond assessing the effects of mere HIT adoption and also considers user-perceived HIT value. In addition, the impact of a variety of technologies beyond EHRs was examined. METHODS: Multiple linear regression models were estimated using emergency care outcomes, elective care outcomes, and patient satisfaction as dependent variables. The adoption and user-perceived value of HIT represented key independent variables, and case volume, hospital size, ownership status, and teaching status were included as controls. Care outcomes were captured via risk-adjusted, observed-to-expected outcome ratios for patients who had stroke, myocardial infarction, or hip replacement. The German Patient Experience Questionnaire of Weisse Liste provided information on patient satisfaction. Information on the adoption and user-perceived value of 10 subdomains of HIT and EHRs was derived from the German 2020 Healthcare IT Report. RESULTS: Statistical analysis was based on an overall sample of 383 German hospitals. The analyzed data set suggested no significant effect of HIT or EHR adoption on clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction. However, a higher user-perceived value or quality of the installed tools did improve outcomes. Emergency care outcomes benefited from user-friendly overall digitization (β=-.032; P=.04), which was especially driven by the user-friendliness of admission HIT (β=-.023; P=.07). Elective care outcomes were positively impacted by user-friendly EHR installations (β=-.138; P=.008). Similarly, the results suggested user-friendly, overall digitization to have a moderate positive effect on patient satisfaction (β=-.009; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that hospital digitization is not an end in itself. Policy makers and hospitals are well advised to not only focus on the mere adoption of digital technologies but also continuously work toward digitization that is perceived as valuable by physicians and nurses who rely on it every day. Furthermore, hospital digitization strategies should consider that the assumed benefits of single technologies are not realized across all care domains.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.2196/40124,Humans;United States;*Hospitals;*Medical Informatics;Electronic Health Records;Patient Satisfaction;Regression Analysis,36355423,PMC9693730

Healthcare information technology can be used to achieve this aim, for example by providing access to prescribing data through surveillance of patients' electronic health records. The aim of our study was to examine the implementation and adoption of an electronic medicines optimisation system that was intended to facilitate clinical audit in primary care by identifying patients at risk of an adverse drug event. We adopted a sociotechnical approach that focuses on how complex social, organisational and institutional factors may impact upon the use of technology within work settings. METHODS: We undertook a qualitative realist evaluation of the use of an electronic medicines optimisation system in one Clinical Commissioning Group in England. Five semi-structured interviews, four focus groups and one observation were conducted with a range of stakeholders. Consistent with a realist evaluation methodology, the analysis focused on exploring the links between context, mechanism and outcome to explain the ways the intervention might work, for whom and in what circumstances. RESULTS: Using the electronic medicines optimisation system could lead to a number of improved patient safety outcomes including pre-emptively reviewing patients at risk of adverse drug events. The effective use of the system depended upon engagement with the system, the flow of information between different health professionals centrally placed at the Clinical Commissioning Group and those locally placed at individual general practices, and upon variably adapting work practices to facilitate the use of the system. The use of the system was undermined by perceptions of ownership, lack of access, and lack of knowledge and awareness. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an electronic medicines optimisation system may improve medication safety in primary care settings by identifying those patients at risk of an adverse drug event. To fully realise the potential benefits for medication safety there needs to be better utilisation across primary care and with a wider range of stakeholders. Engaging with all potential stakeholders and users prior to implementation of such systems might allay perceptions that the system is owned centrally and increase knowledge of the potential benefits.","",10.1186/s12913-017-2131-5,"Clinical Audit;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*prevention & control;Electronic Health Records;England;Evaluation Studies as Topic;General Practice/*methods/organization & administration/standards;Health Personnel;Humans;*Patient Safety/standards;Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards;Primary Health Care/*methods;Quality Improvement",28288634,PMC5348746

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined three data sources: The American Telemedicine Association's 2019 state telehealth analysis, the American Hospital Association's 2018 annual survey of acute care hospitals and its Information Technology Supplement. Telehealth adoption was measured through five telehealth categories. Independent variables included seven hospital characteristics and five reimbursement policies. After bivariate comparisons, we developed a multivariable model using logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with telehealth adoption. RESULTS: Among 2923 US hospitals, 73% had at least one telehealth capability. More than half of these hospitals invested in telehealth consultation services and stroke care. Non-profit hospitals, affiliated hospitals, major teaching hospitals, and hospitals located in micropolitan areas (those with 10-50,000 people) were more likely to adopt telehealth. In contrast, hospitals that lacked electronic clinical documentation, were unaffiliated with a hospital system, or were investor-owned had lower odds of adopting telehealth. None of the statewide policies were associated with adoption of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth policy requires major revisions soon, and we suggest that these policies should be national rather than at the state level. Further steps as incentivizing rural hospitals for adopting interoperable systems and expanding RPM billing opportunities will help drive adoption, and promote equity.","",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104540,*COVID-19;Hospitals;Humans;Policy;SARS-CoV-2;*Telemedicine;United States,34332467,PMC9760418

Although eHealth could be of more value to health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where resources are limited, identification of a competent workforce which can develop and maintain eHealth systems is a key barrier to adoption. Very little is known about the actual or optimal states of the eHealth workforce needs of LMICs. The objective of this study was to develop a framework to characterize and assess the eHealth workforce of hospitals in LMICs. METHODS: To characterize and assess the sufficiency of the workforce, we designed this study in twofold. First, we developed a general framework to categorize the eHealth workforce at any LMIC setting. Second, we combined qualitative data, using semi-structured interviews and the Workload Indicator of Staffing Needs (WISN) to assess the sufficiency of the eHealth workforce in selected hospitals in a LMIC setting like Ghana. RESULTS: We surveyed 76 (60%) of the eHealth staff from three hospitals in Ghana-La General Hospital, University of Ghana Hospital, and Greater Accra Regional Hospital. We identified two main eHealth cadres, technical support/information technology (IT) and health information management (HIM). While the HIM cadre presented diversity in expertise, the IT group was dominated by training in Science (42%) and Engineering (55%), and the majority (87%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Health information clerk (32%), health information officer (25%), help desk specialist (20%), and network administrator (11%) were the most dominant roles. Based on the WISN assessment, the eHealth workforce at all the surveyed sites was insufficient. La General and University of Ghana were operating at 10% of required IT staff capacity, while Ridge was short by 42%. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a framework to characterize and assess the eHealth workforce in LMICs. Applying it to a case study in Ghana has given us a better understanding of potential eHealth staffing needs in LMICs, while providing the quantitative basis for building the requisite human capital to drive eHealth initiatives. Educators can also use our results to explore competency gaps and refine curricula for burgeoning training programs.

Healthcare organizations have made significant investments in HIT tools and the electronic medical record (EMR) is a major technological advance. The Department of Veterans Affairs was one of the first large healthcare systems to fully implement EMR. The Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) began by providing an interface to review and update a patient's medical record with its computerized patient record system. However, since the implementation of the VistA system there has not been an overall substantial adoption of EMR in the ambulatory or inpatient setting. In fact, only 23.9% of physicians were using EMRs in their office-based practices in 2005. A sample from the American Medical Association revealed that EMRs were available in an office setting to 17% of physicians in late 2007 and early 2008. Of these, 17% of physicians with EMR, only 4% were considered to be fully functional EMR systems.

We sought to identify the extent of adoption in Rhode Island and the characteristics of physicians and electronic health records associated with positive experience. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of data collected by the Rhode Island Department of Health for the Health Information Technology Survey 2009 to 2013. Survey questions included provider and practice demographics, health record information, and Likert-type scaled questions regarding how electronic health record use affected clinical practice. RESULTS: The survey response rate ranged from 50% to 65%, with 62% in 2013. Increasing numbers of physicians in Rhode Island use an electronic health record. In 2013, 81% of physicians used one, and adoption varied by clinical subspecialty. Most providers think that electronic health record use improves billing and quality improvement but has not improved job satisfaction. Physicians with longer and more sophisticated electronic health record use report positive effects of introduction on all aspects of practice examined (P < .001). Older physician age is associated with worse opinion of electronic health record introduction (P < .001).

Although GP costs are mainly covered by public services or social insurances in Europe, they are still self-employed physicians everywhere, differently from their colleagues in hospitals who are traditionally employees. TM is a very general term open to various interpretations and definitions. TM can now be practiced by means of modern audio-visual devices and is an alternative to the traditional face-to-face consultation in general practice. Although the adoption of TM seems to be compelling in our era, its practical dissemination in PC has been quite slow so far, and many different concerns have been raised on it. On the whole, TM widespread adoption in PC seems to be more a matter of labor organization and health care funding than of technology and ethics. Larger-scale organizations comprising a wide range of health professionals have become a pressing priority for a modern PC, because working together is crucial to provide high-quality care to patients, and co-location should boost teamwork and facilitate the management of information technology.

The objective of this study was to investigate the current status of overall healthcare ICT, especially focusing on Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in Korea. METHODS: This study used a part of the nationwide survey collected for the OECD benchmarking ICT study. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service conducted the survey from November 19, 2013 to January 10, 2014. This study followed the methodological guidelines of the OECD. A total of 2,093 hospitals and clinics, including long-term care hospitals, participated in the survey. Among them, 554 hospitals and 906 clinics were included in this study for the generalization of the results. RESULTS: The adoption rates of EMR systems were 96.3% in hospitals and 95.7% in clinics. Most of the hospitals and clinics had high rates of healthcare information exchange (HIE) within the organization; however, there were extremely low HIE rates among external organizations. Most of the hospitals and clinics had EMR systems with clinical-decision-supporting functionalities. Ninety-six percent of the EMR systems of the hospitals and 89.2% of the clinic systems had checking functions, such as alerts or reminders, on contraindications of drug-drug and drug-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Korea has maintained a high healthcare ICT status compared to countries in the European Union. The EMR systems of hospitals and clinics in Korea had sophisticated functionalities; however, their HIE status was extremely low, which indicates the need for healthcare ICT standardization.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.4258/hir.2017.23.3.189,"",28875054,PMC5572523

We measured EHR adoption and advanced use over time to analyzed changes in the divide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 2008 to 2018 American Hospital Association Information Technology survey data to update national EHR adoption statistics. We stratified EHR adoption by CAH status and measured advanced use for both patient engagement (PE) and clinical data analytics (CDA) domains. We used a linear probability regression for each domain with year-CAH interactions to measure temporal changes in the relationship between CAH status and advanced use. RESULTS: In 2018, 98.3% of hospitals had adopted EHRs; there were no differences by CAH status. A total of 58.7% and 55.6% of hospitals adopted advanced PE and CDA functions, respectively. In both domains, CAHs were less likely to be advanced users: 46.6% demonstrated advanced use for PE and 32.0% for CDA. Since 2015, the advanced use divide has persisted for PE and widened for CDA. DISCUSSION: EHR adoption among hospitals is essentially ubiquitous; however, CAHs still lag behind in advanced use functions critical to improving care quality. This may be rooted in different advanced use needs among CAH patients and lack of access to technical expertise. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced use divide prevents CAH patients from benefitting from a fully digitized healthcare system. To close the widening gap in CDA, policymakers should consider partnering with vendors to develop implementation guides and standards for functions like dashboards and high-risk patient identification algorithms to better support CAH adoption.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1093/jamia/ocab102,*Electronic Health Records;*Hospitals;Humans;United States,34198342,PMC8363800

There are multiple challenges to implementation of a Hospital GIS for infection prevention, mainly involving the domains of technology, organization, and adaptation. Use of a transdisciplinary approach can address many of these challenges. More research, specifically prospective, reproducible clinical trials, needs to be done to better assess the potential impact and effectiveness of a Hospital GIS in real-world settings.

The project is facing massive resistance from German physicians, which has led to a delay of more than five years. Little is known about the actual burdens and drivers for adoption of e-health innovations by physicians. OBJECTIVE: Based on a quantitative study of German physicians who participated in the national testbed for telemedicine, this article extends existing technology acceptance models (TAM) for electronic health (e-health) in ambulatory care settings and elaborates on determinants of importance to physicians in their decision to use e-health applications. METHODS: This study explores the opinions, attitudes, and knowledge of physicians in ambulatory care to find drivers for technology acceptance in terms of information technology (IT) utilization, process and security orientation, standardization, communication, documentation and general working patterns. We identified variables within the TAM constructs used in e-health research that have the strongest evidence to determine the intention to use e-health applications. RESULTS: The partial least squares (PLS) regression model from data of 117 physicians showed that the perceived importance of standardization and the perceived importance of the current IT utilization (p<0.01) were the most significant drivers for accepting electronic health services (EHS) in their practice. Significant influence (p<0.05) was shown for the perceived importance of information security and process orientation as well as the documentation intensity and the e-health-related knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends work gleaned from technology acceptance studies in healthcare by investigating factors which influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of e-health services.

Portal messages exchanged between patients and providers contain diverse types of communications, including delivery of medical care. The types of communications and complexity of medical decision-making in portal messages sent to surgeons have not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained all message threads initiated by patients and exchanged with surgical providers through the Vanderbilt University Medical Center patient portal from June 1 to December 31, 2014. Five hundred randomly selected messages were manually analyzed by two research team members to determine the types of communication (i.e., informational, medical, logistical, or social), whether medical care was delivered, and complexity of medical decision-making as defined for outpatient billing in each message thread. RESULTS: A total of 9408 message threads were sent to 401 surgical providers during the study period. In the 500 threads selected for detailed analysis, 1293 distinct issues were communicated, with an average of 2.6 issues per thread. Medical needs were communicated in 453 message threads (90.6%).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a framework for future research by identifying themes in the long-term care information technology sector that could function to enable the adoption and use of HIE mechanisms for patient handoff between long-term care facilities and other levels of care to increase communication between providers, shorten length of stay, reduce 60-day readmissions, and increase patient safety. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic search of literature through CINAHL, PubMed, and Discovery Services for Texas A&M University Libraries. Search terms used were (""health information exchange"" OR ""healthcare information exchange"" OR ""HIE"") AND (""long term care"" OR ""long-term care"" OR ""nursing home"" OR ""nursing facility"" OR ""skilled nursing facility"" OR ""SNF"" OR ""residential care"" OR ""assisted living"").

All articles were reviewed by all reviewers and literature not relevant to the research objective was excluded. RESULTS: Researchers selected and reviewed 22 articles for common themes. Results concluded that the largest facilitator and barrier to the adoption of HIE mechanisms is workflow integration/augmentation and the organizational structure/culture, respectively. Other identified facilitator themes were enhanced communication, increased effectiveness of care, and patient safety. The additional barriers were missing/incomplete data, inefficiency, and market conditions. CONCLUSION: The long-term care industry has been left out of incentives from which the industry could have benefited tremendously.

These errors are known as technology-induced errors and they typically manifest themselves in the complex interaction between healthcare providers and HIT during real clinical use. In this paper the author explores the concept of technology-induced error in healthcare and discusses a range of strategies for detecting and mitigating such errors. Strategies include creating new organizations whose focus is to reduce technology-induced errors, develop and deploy new ways to detect such errors before systems are released, as well as approaches to reporting such errors after they occur.

RESULTS: Hospitalists staffing level is shown to be positively correlated with TPS. High-level EMR adoption is associated with both short-term and long-term improvement on TPS. Large, urban, non-federal government hospitals, and academic medical centers tend to have lower TPS compared to their respective counterparts. Hospitals belonging to medium- or large-sized healthcare systems have lower TPS. Higher registered nurse (RN) staffing level is associated with higher TPS, while higher percentage of Medicare or Medicaid share of inpatient days is associated with lower TPS. DISCUSSION: Although the main effects of hospitalists staffing level and EMR capability are significant, their interaction is not, suggesting that hospitalists and EMR act through separate mechanisms to help hospitals achieve better performance. When hospitals are not able to invest on both simultaneously, given financial constraints, they can still reap the full benefits from each. CONCLUSION: Hospitalists staffing level and EMR capability are both positively correlated with hospitals' TPS, and they act independently to bolster hospital performance.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1177/09514848211001696,Aged;Electronic Health Records;*Hospitalists;Humans;Medicare;United States;Value-Based Purchasing;Workforce,33726545,

We describe the design and implementation of decision-support electronic tools by the Ministry of Health of the State of Chiapas, in Mexico, as part of Salud Mesoamerica Initiative. METHODS: Three electronic decision-support tools were designed through an iterative process focused on streamlined implementation: 1) to collect and report health facility data at health facilities; 2) to compile and analyze data at health district and central level; and, 3) to support stratified sampling of health facilities. Data was collected for five composite indicators measuring availability of equipment, medicines, and supplies for maternal and child health. Quality Assurance Teams collected data, evaluated results and supported quality improvement. Data was also analyzed at the central level and health districts for decision-making. RESULTS: Data from 300 health facilities in four health districts was collected and analyzed (November 2014-June 2015). The first wave revealed gaps on availability of equipment and supplies in more than half of health facilities. Electronic tools provided the ministry of health officers new ways to visualize data, identify patterns and make hypothesis on root-causes. Between the first and second measurement, the number of missing items decreased, and actions performed by quality improvement teams became more proactive. In the final measurement, 89.7-100% of all health facilities achieved all the required items for each indicator. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience could help guide others seeking to implement electronic decision-support tools in low- and middle-income countries. Electronic decision-support tools supported data-driven decision-making by identifying gaps on heatmaps and graphs at the health facility, subdistrict, district or state level.

Because of this, acceptance and adoption of EHRs is less of a concern than adaptation to use. To understand this issue more deeply, we conducted a qualitative study of physician perspectives on EHR use to identify factors that facilitate adaptation. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 physicians across a range of inpatient disciplines at a large Academic Medical Center. Interviews were conducted by phone, lasting approximately 30 min, and were transcribed verbatim for analysis. We utilized inductive and deductive methods in our analysis. RESULTS: We identified 4 major themes related to EHR adaptation: impact of EHR changes on physicians, how physicians managed these changes, factors that facilitated adaptation to using the EHR and adapting to using the EHR in the patient encounter. Within these themes, physicians felt that a positive mindset toward change, providing upgrade training that was tailored to their role, and the opportunity to learn from colleagues were important facilitators of adaptation.

National ICU registries were created almost 3 decades ago to improve the understanding of case-mix, resource use, and outcomes of critically ill patients. This narrative review describes the challenges, proposed solutions, and evidence generated by National ICU registries as facilitators for research and quality improvement. DATA SOURCES: English language articles were identified in PubMed using phrases related to ICU registries, CQRs, outcomes, and case-mix. STUDY SELECTION: Original research, review articles, letters, and commentaries, were considered. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from relevant literature were identified, reviewed, and integrated into a concise narrative review. DATA SYNTHESIS: CQRs have been implemented worldwide by several medical specialties aiming to generate a better characterization of epidemiology, treatments, and outcomes of patients. National ICU registries were created almost 3 decades ago to improve the understanding of case-mix, resource use, and outcomes of critically ill patients. The initial experience in European countries and in Oceania ensured that through locally generated data, ICUs could assess their performances by using risk-adjusted measures and compare their results through fair and validated benchmarking metrics with other ICUs contributing to the CQR. The accomplishment of these initiatives, coupled with the increasing adoption of information technology, resulted in a broad geographic expansion of CQRs as well as their use in quality improvement studies, clinical trials as well as international comparisons, and benchmarking for ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: ICU registries have provided increased knowledge of case-mix and outcomes of ICU patients based on real-world data and contributed to improve care delivery through quality improvement initiatives and trials.

The objective of this study is to investigate factors associated with healthcare organizations' adoption of PHR systems in South Korea. METHODS: The units of analysis were hospitals with more than 100 beds. Study data of 313 hospitals were collected from May 1 to June 30, 2020. The PHR adoption status for each hospital was collected from PHR vendors and online searches. Adoption was then confirmed by downloading the hospital's PHR app and the PHR app was examined to ascertain its available functions. One major outcome variable was PHR adoption status at hospital level. Data were analysed by logistic regressions using SAS 9.4 version. RESULTS: Out of 313 hospitals, 103 (32.9%) hospitals adopted PHR systems. The nurse-patient ratio was significantly associated with PHR adoption (OR 0.758; 0.624 to 0.920, p = 0.005). The number of health information management staff was associated with PHR adoption (OR 1.622; 1.228 to 2.141, p = 0.001).

To address this deficit, we assessed the difference between Medicaid providers who did and did not achieve Meaningful Use regarding Florida county-level cumulative COVID-19 death, case and case fatality rates (CFR), accounting for county-level demographics, socioeconomic and clinical markers, and healthcare environment. We found that cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 deaths and CFRs were significantly different between the 5025 Medicaid providers not achieving Meaningful Use and the 3723 achieving Meaningful Use (mean 0.8334/1000 population; SD = 0.3489 vs. mean = 0.8216/1000; SD = 0.3227, respectively) (P = .01).

In accordance with other studies, social determinants of health were independently associated with clinical outcomes. Our findings also suggest that the association between Florida counties' public health outcomes and Meaningful Use achievement may have had less to do with using EHRs for reporting of clinical outcomes and more to do with using EHRs for coordination of care-a key measure of quality. The Florida Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program which incentivized Medicaid providers towards achieving Meaningful Use, has demonstrated success regarding both rates of adoption and clinical outcomes.

To fully uncover consumer patterns it is imperative to recognize common barriers and which groups they disproportionately affect. Finally, exploring future demand and predictions will expose significant opportunities for health IT. The most frequently used health information technologies by consumers are gathering information online, mobile health (mHealth) technologies, and personal health records (PHRs). Gathering health information online is the favored pathway for healthcare consumers as it is used by more consumers and more frequently than any other technology. In regard to mHealth technologies, minority Americans, compared with White Americans utilize social media, mobile Internet, and mobile applications more frequently.

However, our healthcare system remains poorly equipped to address social determinants of health. The potential of health information technology to bridge this gap across the delivery of healthcare and social services remains unrealized. OBJECTIVE, DESIGN, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted in-depth, in-person interviews with 50 healthcare and social service providers to determine the feasibility of a social-health information exchange (S-HIE) in an urban safety-net setting in Dallas County, Texas. After completion of interviews, we conducted a town hall meeting to identify desired functionalities for a S-HIE. APPROACH: We conducted thematic analysis of interview responses using the constant comparative method to explore perceptions about current communication and coordination across sectors, and barriers and enablers to S-HIE implementation. We sought participant confirmation of findings and conducted a forced-rank vote during the town hall to prioritize potential S-HIE functionalities. KEY RESULTS: We found that healthcare and social service providers perceived a need for improved information sharing, communication, and care coordination across sectors and were enthusiastic about the potential of a S-HIE, but shared many technical, legal, and ethical concerns around cross-sector information sharing. Desired technical S-HIE functionalities encompassed fairly simple transactional operations such as the ability to view basic demographic information, visit and referral data, and medical history from both healthcare and social service settings. CONCLUSIONS: A S-HIE is an innovative and feasible approach to enabling better linkages between healthcare and social service providers.

Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. RESULTS: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.2196/23315,"Data Analysis;Decision Support Systems, Clinical/*standards;Electronic Health Records/*standards;Health Personnel/*economics;*Hermeneutics;Humans",33206056,PMC7710451

METHODS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to survey Chief Information Officers at all 21 of New Zealand's District Health Boards regarding the extent to which their organisations use knowledge sharing activities involving ITs. The list of activities to include in the questionnaire was compiled by reviewing the literature. We analysed the extent of use of the knowledge sharing activities using descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 76%. Although all the responding organisations reported using ITs to share knowledge, they used ITs to share documents significantly more than to support discussions or to connect employees to experts. Discussions via teleconferencing, videoconferencing, and email lists were significantly more common than discussions via social media technologies: electronic discussion forums, blogs, and on-line chatrooms. There were significant positive correlations between publishing and accessing documents, between using teleconferencing and using videoconferencing, and between publishing and finding contact details of experts. CONCLUSION: New Zealand's District Health Boards are using a range of ITs to share knowledge. Knowledge sharing activities emphasising the sharing of explicit knowledge (via exchanging documents in electronic form) are significantly more common than knowledge sharing activities emphasising the sharing of tacit knowledge (via technology-mediated discussions and via using technology to connect employees to experts). In view of the evidence in the literature that information technology may be highly effective in supporting tacit knowledge exchanges, our results suggest that health organisations should consider greater adoption of ITs for sharing tacit knowledge.

The sample of participants consisted of patients and family members affiliated with Canada's largest mental health hospital located in Toronto, Ontario. Study results indicated that patients had the highest interest in the following portal functions: scheduling appointments, checking appointment times, and accessing their health record. Both patients and family members expressed their concerns about cybersecurity and potential privacy breaches.

However, previous attempts to convince the private clinics to adopt EMRs to document health information have faced challenges, as the EMR adoption has been voluntary. The lack of electronic data shared by private clinics carries direct impacts to the efficacy of electronic record sharing between public and private healthcare providers. To increase the likelihood of buy-in, it is essential to proactively identify the users' and organizations' needs and capabilities before large-scale implementation. As part of the reform initiative, this study examined factors affecting the adoption of EMRs in small or solo private general practice clinics, by analyzing the experiences and opinions of the physicians and clinical assistants during the pilot implementation of the technology, with the purpose to learn from it before full-scale rollout. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 23 physicians and clinical assistants from seven small or solo private general practice clinics to evaluate their experiences, expectations, and opinions regarding the deployment of EMRs. Interview transcripts were content analyzed to identify key factors. Factors affecting the adoption of EMRs to record and manage health care information were identified as follows: system interface design; system functions; stability and reliability of hardware, software, and computing networks; financial and time costs; task and outcome performance, work practice, and clinical workflow; physical space in clinics; trust in technology; users' information technology literacy; training and technical support; and social and organizational influences. The factors are interrelated with the others. The adoption factors identified are multifaceted, ranging from technological characteristics, clinician-technology interactions, skills and knowledge, and the user-workflow-technology fit. Other findings, which have been relatively underrepresented in previous studies, contribute unique insights about the influence of work and social environment on the adoption of EMRs, including limited clinic space and the effects of physicians' decision to use the technology on clinical staffs' adoption decisions.

This article presents results from a multi-stakeholder project that developed a new concept, a 'shared service centre' for telemedicine that is envisioned as working across different telemedical initiatives to support the implementation and wider adoption of telemedicine. One year of participatory design and analysis of the shared service centre concept involved stakeholders, such as clinicians, patients, technicians, policy makers, lawyers, economists and information technology architects. More than 100 people contributed to the findings. Most of the ideas generated for potential centre support for telemedicine could be categorised under four service categories. The need for such support services was verified in the cases investigated, and by agreement among stakeholders from regional health authorities, municipalities, and general practice. Therefore, it is probable that a shared service centre could help enable the wider deployment of telemedicine. DEFINITIONS: In this article, we use 'telemedicine' as an umbrella term for all the 'tele-' labels that are sometimes used rather indiscriminately to denote the use of information and technology to support healthcare services, including 'telehealth', 'telemonitoring', 'telehomecare', 'e-health', and so on. As per our definition, telemedicine may be synchronous and/or asynchronous, and may apply to any information and technology-based means of connecting healthcare actors and the patient, such as video communication, e-mail, electronic monitoring equipment, and Internet portals. Furthermore, the term 'telemedical initiative' covers projects in which telemedicine is conducted by a temporary project organisation, as well as self-contained telemedicine services used in daily, clinical practice in existing organisations.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1177/1460458215592042,Community Health Centers/*statistics & numerical data;Denmark;Humans;*Organizational Innovation;Telemedicine/instrumentation/*methods,26261216,PMC5117122

These 'intelligent' technical paradigms provide a new digital 'toolkit' supporting drug safety and healthcare processes, including 'active pharmacovigilance'. While these technical paradigms are promising, intelligent systems (ISs) are not yet widely adopted by pharmacovigilance (PV) stakeholders, namely the pharma industry, academia/research community, drug safety monitoring organizations, regulatory authorities, and healthcare institutions. The limitations obscuring the integration of ISs into PV activities are multifaceted, involving technical, legal and medical hurdles, and thus require further elucidation. OBJECTIVE: We dissect the abovementioned limitations by describing the lessons learned during the design and implementation of the PVClinical platform, a web platform aiming to support the investigation of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs), emphasizing the use of knowledge engineering (KE) as its main technical paradigm. RESULTS: To this end, we elaborate on the related 'business processes' (i.e. operational processes) and 'user goals' identified as part of the PVClinical platform design process based on Design Thinking principles. We also elaborate on key challenges restricting the adoption of such ISs and their integration in the clinical setting and beyond.

Many studies have used AR/VR to deliver training, providing mixed evidence on their effectiveness and limited evidence regarding contextual factors that influence effectiveness and implementation. This review will develop, test and refine an evidence-informed programme theory on what facilitates or constrains the implementation of AR or VR programmes in health and care settings and understand how, for whom and to what extent they 'work'. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This realist review adheres to the Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) standards and will be conducted in three steps: theory elicitation, theory testing and theory refinement. First, a search will identify practitioner, academic and learning and technology adoption theories from databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, Education Resources Information Center, PsycINFO and Web of Science), practitioner journals, snowballing and grey literature. Information regarding contexts, mechanisms and outcomes will be extracted. A narrative synthesis will determine overlapping configurations and form an initial theory. Second, the theory will be tested using empirical evidence located from the above databases and identified from the first search. Quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and relevant information will be extracted into a coding sheet. Third, the extracted information will be compared with the initial programme theory, with differences helping to make refinements. Findings will be presented as a narrative summary, and the MMAT will determine our confidence in each configuration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required.

Key aspects include assessment of design, implementation and adoption contexts; ensuring systems support and optimise human performance (which in turn requires understanding clinical and system logics); and ensuring that design of systems prioritises ethics, equity, effectiveness, and outcomes. Going forward, information technology strategy, implementation and assessment need to actively incorporate these dimensions. International policy makers, regulators and strategic decision makers in implementing organisations therefore need to be cognisant of these aspects and incorporate them in decision-making and in prioritising investment. In particular, the emphasis needs to be on stronger and more evidence-based evaluation surrounding system limitations and risks as well as optimisation of outcomes, whilst ensuring learning and contextual review.

METHODS: Retrospective Electronic Health Record analysis of enrollment in patient portal from January 2010 to May 2016 among 10,464 patients with at least one outpatient urology clinic visit. Differences in adoption rates were examined using logistic regression for the following categories: activated (or caregiver activated); code accepted not activated; declined; or activated/then deactivated. RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% of patients/caregivers activated the portal. Primarily Spanish-speaking patients were less likely to activate (OR 0.25, p <.001) than English-speaking patients.

To this end, we discuss the theory that exists today to explain some of the usage principles affiliated with information technology implementation in healthcare; namely, we reflect on the Technology Adoption Criteria in Health (TEACH) model and Wagner's Chronic Disease Management model. The basic premise of the TEACH model is that adoption requires work; this work must be recognized at the outset, and the progress to overcome the workload increase must be measured for the adoption to continue.

The adoption of personalized medicine will require changes in healthcare infrastructure, diagnostics and therapeutics business models, reimbursement policy from government and private payers, and a different approach to regulatory oversight. Personalized medicine will shift medical practices upstream from the reactive treatment of disease, to proactive healthcare management including screening, early treatment, and prevention, and will alter the roles of both physician and patient. It will create a greater reliance on electronic medical records and decision support systems in an industry that has a long history of resistance to information technology. Personalized medicine requires a systems approach to implementation. But in a healthcare economy that is highly decentralized and market driven, it is incumbent upon the stakeholders themselves to advocate for a consistent set of policies and legislation that pave the way for the adoption of personalized medicine. To address this need, the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC) was formed as a nonprofit umbrella organization of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, and information technology companies, healthcare providers and payers, patient advocacy groups, industry policy organizations, major academic institutions, and government agencies. The PMC provides a structure for achieving consensus positions among these stakeholders on crucial public policy issues, a role which will be vital to translating personalized medicine into widespread clinical practice.

According to the master plan, electronic health record (EHR) research and development projects were designed in 2005. One subproject was the design and implementation of standards-based interoperable clinical decision support (CDS) capabilities in the context of the EHR system. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the challenges, process, and outcomes of defining and implementing a national CDS architecture to stimulate and motivate the widespread adoption of CDS services in Korea. METHODS: CDS requirements and design principles were established by conducting a selective literature review and a survey of clinicians, managers, and hospital and industrial health information technology engineers regarding issues related to CDS architectures. The previous relevant works of the American Medical Informatics Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, and Health Level Seven were used to validate the scope and themes of the service architecture. The Arden Syntax, Standards-Based Sharable Active Guideline Environment, First DataBank, and SEBASTIAN approaches were used to assess the coverage of the application architecture thus defined. A CDS prototype of an outpatient hypertension management system was implemented and assessed in a simulated experimental setting to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed architecture. RESULTS: Four CDS service features were identified: knowledge application, knowledge management, audit and evaluation, and CDS and knowledge governance. Five core components of CDS application architecture were also identified: knowledge-execution component, knowledge-authoring component, data-interface component, knowledge repository, and service-interface component. The coverage and characteristics of the architecture identified herein were found to be comparable with those described previously. Two scenarios of deployment architecture were identified in the context of Korean healthcare. The preliminary feasibility test revealed that the architecture exhibited good performance and made it easy to integrate patient data.

In order to inform UK strategy on how to catalyse innovation, we sought to understand what national strategies can help to promote a climate for innovation in healthcare settings by extracting lessons for the UK from international innovators. METHODS: We undertook a series of qualitative semi-structured interviews with senior international innovators from a range of health related policy, care/service delivery, commercial and academic backgrounds. Thematic analysis helped to explore how different stakeholder groups could facilitate/inhibit innovation at individual, organisational, and wider societal levels. RESULTS: We conducted 14 interviews and found that a conducive climate for healthcare innovation comprised of national/regional strategies stimulating commercial competition, promoting public/private relationships, and providing central direction (e.g. incentives for adoption and regulation through standards) without being restrictive. Organisational attitudes with a willingness to experiment and to take risks were also seen as important, but a bottom-up approach to innovation, based on the identification of clinical need, was seen as a crucial first step to construct relevant national policies. CONCLUSIONS: There is now a need to create mechanisms through which frontline National Health Service staff in relation can raise ideas/concerns and suggest opportunities for improvement, and then build national innovation environments that seek to address these needs.

METHODS: Four technical strategies were identified and the forms of coupling they made with healthcare agencies were classified. A study was conducted in England to examine the human and organizational implications of systems implemented by these four strategies. Results were used from evaluation reports of two systems delivered as part of the NPfIT (National Programme for Information Technology) and from user responses to systems delivered in two local health communities in England. In the latter study 40 clinical respondents reported the use of systems to support integrated care in six healthcare pathways. RESULTS: The implementation of a detailed care record system (DCRS) in the NPfIT was problematic because it could not meet the diverse needs of all healthcare agencies and it required considerable local customization. The programme evolved to allow different systems to be delivered for each local health community. A national Summary Care Record (SCR) was implemented but many concerns were raised about wide access to confidential patient information. The two technical strategies that required looser forms of coupling and were under local control led to wide user adoption. The systems that enabled data to be transferred between local systems were successfully used to support integrated care in specific healthcare pathways. The portal approach gave many users an opportunity to view patient data held on a number of databases and this system evolved over a number of years as a result of requests from the user community. CONCLUSIONS: The UK national strategy to deliver single shared database systems requires tight coupling between many users and has led to poor adoption because of the diverse needs of healthcare agencies. Sharing patient information has been more successful when local systems have been developed to serve particular healthcare pathways or when separate databases are viewable through a portal. On the basis of this evidence technical strategies that permit the local design of tight coupling are necessary if information systems are to support integrated care in healthcare pathways.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Some Focus,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.004,"*Cooperative Behavior;Databases, Factual;*Delivery of Health Care;Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/*methods/*organization & administration;*Electronic Health Records;Humans;Information Systems;*Telemedicine",23266062,

Shared decision making (SDM) is a process by which the patient and provider jointly make a healthcare choice. SDM improves patient outcomes; however, implementation barriers of time constraints and staff availability are limitations. The use of health IT solutions may increase the adoption of SDM, but best practices for implementation are not well understood. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a flexible comprehensive model used to identify barriers and facilitators influencing implementation. The goal of this study is to implement an innovative web-based pediatric SDM tool in the real-world setting of two large healthcare system EDs through the following aims: (1) convene a patient, research, and ED stakeholder advisory board to oversee review of protocol and study materials prior to implementation, (2) implement the SDM intervention where providers and staff will be trained to incorporate use of this SDM intervention, (3) conduct on-going evaluation of barriers, facilitators, and implementation outcomes to tailor implementation in the EDs, (4) evaluate patient-centered outcomes of primary care utilization and changes in ED visits and hospitalizations before and after the SDM intervention, and (5) understand and document best practices for ED implementation. METHODS: The CFIR model will guide the implementation evaluation. Researchers will administer surveys to the clinical team and patients at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months to inform implementation design, determine barriers and facilitators, and resource-needs to allow for real-time process adjustments within the EDs. Focus group or key-informant interviews and analysis will provide additional feedback to the stakeholder team to iterate the implementation process. Researchers will track patient-centered outcomes including increased primary care, ED, and inpatient utilization over the duration of the study. DISCUSSION: To advance asthma care and the field of implementation science, further research is needed to assess best practices for incorporating SDM into high-need healthcare settings such as the ED.

Clinicians and administrative staff use these applications at bedside workstations, in operating rooms, at nursing stations, in physician's rooms, and in other various settings. The intention of a CIS or an ARK system is to facilitate creation of electronic records of data, assessments, and procedures from multiple medical devices. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of the Chief of Nursing Informatics sought to understand usage barriers and facilitators to optimize these systems in the future. Therefore, a human factors study was carried out to observe the CIS and ARK systems in use at three VAMCs in order to identify best practices and suggested improvements to currently implemented CIS and ARK systems. METHODS: We conducted a rapid ethnographic study of clinical end-users interacting with the CIS and ARK systems in the critical care and anesthesia care areas in each of three geographically distributed VAMCs. Two observers recorded interactions and/or interview responses from 88 CIS and ARK end-users. We coded and sorted into logical categories field notes from 69 shadowed participants. The team transcribed and combined data from key informant interviews with 19 additional participants with the observation data. We then integrated findings across observations into meaningful patterns and abstracted the data into themes, which translated directly to barriers to effective adoption and optimization of the CIS and ARK systems. RESULTS: Effective optimization of the CIS and ARK systems was impeded by: (1) integration issues with other software systems; (2) poor usability; (3) software challenges; (4) hardware challenges; (5) training concerns; (6) unclear roles and lack of coordination among stakeholders; and (7) insufficient technical support. Many of these barriers are multi-faceted and have associated sub-barriers, which are described in detail along with relevant quotes from participants. In addition, regionalized purchases of different CIS and ARK systems, as opposed to enterprise level purchases, contributed to some of the identified barriers. Facilitators to system use included (1) automation and (2) a dedicated facility-level CIS-ARK Coordinator. CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers that explain some of the challenges with the optimization of the CIS and ARK commercial systems across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). To help address these barriers, and evolve them into facilitators, we categorized report findings as (1) interface and system-level changes that vendors or VA healthcare systems can implement; (2) implementation factors under VA control and not under VA control; and (3) factors that may be used to inform future application purchases. We outline several recommendations for improved adoption of CIS and ARK systems and further recommend that human factors engineering and usability requirements become an integral part of VA health information technology (HIT) application procurement, customization, and implementation in order to help eliminate or mitigate some of the barriers of use identified in this study.

By 2015, medical care receiving service reimbursement from US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must show 'meaningful use' of EHRs. Substance use disorders (SUD) are grossly under-detected and under-treated in current US medical care settings. Hence, an urgent need exists for improved identification of and clinical intervention for SUD in medical settings. The National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN) has leveraged its infrastructure and expertise and brought relevant stakeholders together to develop consensus on brief screening and initial assessment tools for SUD in general medical settings, with the objective of incorporation into US EHRs. METHODS: Stakeholders were identified and queried for input and consensus on validated screening and assessment for SUD in general medical settings to develop common data elements to serve as shared resources for EHRs on screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT), with the intent of supporting interoperability and data exchange in a developing Nationwide Health Information Network. RESULTS: Through consensus of input from stakeholders, a validated screening and brief assessment instrument, supported by Clinical Decision Support tools, was chosen to be used at out-patient general medical settings.

These messages are intelligently filtered to enhance the health and clinical care of patients. CDSSs may be integrated with patient electronic health records (EHRs) and evidence-based knowledge. METHODS/DESIGN: We designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of patient-specific, evidence-based reminders generated at the point-of-care by a multi-specialty decision support system on clinical practice and the quality of care. We will include all the patients admitted to the internal medicine department of one large general hospital. The primary outcome is the rate at which medical problems, which are detected by the decision support software and reported through the reminders, are resolved (i.e., resolution rates). Secondary outcomes are resolution rates for reminders specific to venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, in-hospital all causes and VTE-related mortality, and the length of hospital stay during the study period. DISCUSSION: The adoption of CDSSs is likely to increase across healthcare systems due to growing concerns about the quality of medical care and discrepancy between real and ideal practice, continuous demands for a meaningful use of health information technology, and the increasing use of and familiarity with advanced technology among new generations of physicians. The results of our study will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of CDSSs in primary care and hospital settings, thereby informing future research and healthcare policy questions related to the feasibility and value of CDSS use in healthcare systems. This trial is seconded by a specialty trial randomizing patients in an oncology setting (ONCO-CODES).

Materials and Methods: The online questionnaire in German assessed socio-demographic characteristics, telehealth readiness as well as opinions on smoke-free and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) apps. We used descriptive statistics to report the finding. Results: We received valid responses from 55 participants (mean age 52.3 years, 69.1% males). Telehealth readiness was medium, indicating existence of certain barriers adversely impacting telehealth use. As for apps targeting smoking cessation and COPD, respondents indicated high relevance for visualization aspects for patients and control/overview features for the treating doctors. Only 40% of participants indicated that they would recommend a COPD app to an older patient. Conclusions: In smoking cessation therapy, doctors commonly adhere to the ""5 A's"": Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange.

Considerable uncertainty remains about the impact of these requirements on the effective application of EHR systems. OBJECTIVE: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-sponsored Centers for Education and Research in Therapeutics (CERTs) critically examined the impact of the MU policy relating to the use of medications and jointly developed recommendations to help inform future HIT policy. METHODS: We gathered perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders (N=35) who had experience with MU requirements, including academicians, practitioners, and policy makers from different health care organizations including and beyond the CERTs. Specific issues and recommendations were discussed and agreed on as a group. RESULTS: Stakeholders' knowledge and experiences from implementing MU requirements fell into 6 domains: (1) accuracy of medication lists and medication reconciliation, (2) problem list accuracy and the shift in HIT priorities, (3) accuracy of allergy lists and allergy-related standards development, (4) support of safer and effective prescribing for children, (5) considerations for rural communities, and (6) general issues with achieving MU. Standards are needed to better facilitate the exchange of data elements between health care settings. Several organizations felt that their preoccupation with fulfilling MU requirements stifled innovation. Greater emphasis should be placed on local HIT configurations that better address population health care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Although MU has stimulated adoption of EHRs, its effects on quality and safety remain uncertain. Stakeholders felt that MU requirements should be more flexible and recognize that integrated models may achieve information-sharing goals in alternate ways.

The increasing availability of mobile connectivity needs to be exploited by offering healthcare through a mobile medium, popularly known as mobile health (m-health). It is essential to understand the awareness, perception, and attitude of healthcare providers (HCPs) in deploying m-health. Their outlook on new technologies influences patient adoption. Reports on attitudes regarding healthcare through mobile phones are now confined to views from the recipient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study from August 1 to September 30, 2014 analyzed the views of 592 HCPs (12.3% of all HCPs) in Himachal Pradesh, India. They included faculty and students of the two medical colleges, as well as HCPs from all of the 12 districts. RESULTS: Although Himachal Pradesh has the highest teledensity of all states in India (117.6%), only 58.8% of HCPs (of those surveyed, 72% lived in suburban areas and 24.8% in Shimla, the state capital) would easily recommend m-health. Self-perceived ability to use mobile services was 85%. Fifty-nine percent used mobile devices for social networking, and 52.4% used Wi-Fi. Sixty-one percent of those interviewed were females, and 39% were males. CONCLUSIONS: The transformative potential of m-health hinges on its acceptance and use by all stakeholders. The study suggests that as HCPs in Himachal Pradesh are already using mobile value added services and are highly information technology literate, addressing their specific concerns could lead to use of m-health in Himachal Pradesh.

Despite widespread adoption of DHTs by primary care clinicians, documented challenges have contributed to inequitable use and benefit. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adoption of DHTs, accelerated by state and federal policy changes, in order to meet patient needs and ensure access to care. METHODS: The Digital Health Tools Study employed a mixed methods approach to assess adoption and use of DHTs by primary care clinicians in southeastern states and identify individual- and practice-level barriers and facilitators to DHT implementation. A survey was conducted using a multi-modal recruitment strategy: newsletters, meeting/conference presentations, social media, and emails/calls. Focus groups were conducted to assess priorities, barriers, and facilitators and were recorded/transcribed verbatim. Descriptive statistics were calculated for survey results, produced for the whole sample, and stratified by state. Thematic analysis was conducted of focus group transcripts. RESULTS: There were 1215 survey respondents. About 55 participants who had missing demographic information were excluded from the analysis. About 99% of clinicians used DHTs in the last 5 years, modalities included: telehealth (66%), electronic health records (EHRs; 66%), patient portals (49%), health information exchange (HIE; 41%), prescription drug monitoring programs (39%), remote/home monitoring (27%), and wearable devices (22%). Time (53%) and cost (51%) were identified as barriers. About 61% and 75% of clinicians reported being ""satisfied"" to ""very satisfied"" with telemedicine and EHRs, respectively. Seven focus groups with 25 clinicians were conducted and indicated COVID-19 and the use of supplemental tools/apps to connect patients to resources as major motivators for adopting DHTs. Challenges included incomplete and difficult-to-utilize HIE interfaces for providers and internet/broadband access and poor connectivity for patients.

METHOD: This retrospective analysis utilizes provider audit logs from the Veterans Health Administration Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) and patient responses to the Survey of Patient Healthcare Experiences Patient-Centered Medical Home (SHEP/PCMH) patient satisfaction survey (FY2016) to assess the relationship between the primary care provider being an early adopter of JLV and patient perception of the provider's knowledge of their medical history. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for patient age, race, sex education, health status, duration of patient-provider relationship, and provider characteristics. RESULTS: The study used responses from 203,903 patients to the SHEP-PCMH survey in FY2016 who received outpatient primary care services from 11,421 unique providers. Most (91%) clinicians had no JLV utilization in the 6 months prior to the studied patient visit. Controlling for patient demographics, length of the patient-provider relationship, and provider and facility characteristics, being an early adopter of the JLV system was associated with a 14% (adj OR 1.14, p < 0.000) increased odds that patients felt their provider was knowledgeable about their medical history. When evaluating the interaction between duration of patient-provider relationship and being an early adopter of JLV, a greater effect was seen with patient-provider relationships that were greater than 3 years (adj OR 1.23, p < 0.000), compared to those less than 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the interoperability of medical information systems has the potential to improve both patient care and patient experience of care. This study demonstrates that early adopters of an integrated view of electronic health records from multiple delivery systems are more likely to have their patients report that their clinician was knowledgeable of their medical history. With provider payments often linked to patient satisfaction performance metrics, investments in interoperability may be worthwhile.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Less Focus,10.1007/s11606-018-4708-z,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Ambulatory Care/organization & administration;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;Female;*Health Care Surveys;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data;Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data;Primary Health Care/*organization & administration;Retrospective Studies;United States",30338474,PMC6318162

Several modifications of the HEICS are suggested to match the needs of hospital emergency management today, including: (1) an Incident Consultant in the Administrative Section of the HEICS to provide expert advice directly to the Incident Commander in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) emergencies as needed, as well as consultation on mental health needs; (2) new unit leaders in the Operations Section to coordinate the management of contaminated or infectious patients in CBRN emergencies; (3) new unit leaders in the Operations Section to coordinate mental health support for patients, guests, healthcare workers, volunteers, and dependents in terrorism-related emergencies or events that produce significant mental health needs; (4) a new Decedent/Expectant Unit Leader in the Operations Section to coordinate the management of both types of patients together; and (5) a new Information Technology Unit Leader in the Logistics Section to coordinate the management of information technology and systems. New uses of the HEICS in hospital emergency management also are recommended, including: (1) the adoption of the HEICS as the conceptual framework for organizing all phases of hospital emergency management, including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery; and (2) the application of the HEICS not only to healthcare facilities, but also to healthcare systems. Finally, three levels of healthcare worker competencies in the HEICS are suggested: (1) basic understanding of the HEICS for all hospital healthcare workers; (2) advanced understanding and proficiency in the HEICS for hospital healthcare workers likely to assume leadership roles in hospital emergency response; and (3) special proficiency in constituting the HEICS ad hoc from existing healthcare workers in resource-deficient settings.

METHODS: Extensive research was performed on PHRs through standard literature search, product demonstrations, educational webinars, and fact finding via news releases. RESULTS: Various stakeholders are eager to transform the healthcare industry into the digital age like other industries (i.e., banking, retail). Despite low adoption of PHRs in 2008 (2.7% of U.S. adults), patients are interested in secure messaging and eVisits with their physicians, online appointment scheduling and reminders, and online access to their laboratory and radiology results. Federal agencies (e.g., Health and Human Services, Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs [VA]), popular information technology (IT) vendors (e.g., Google, Microsoft), and large insurers (e.g., Aetna) have energized the industry through pilot programs and new product announcements. It remains to be seen if barriers to adoption, including privacy concerns, lack of interoperability standards and funding, and provider resistance, can be overcome to enable PHRs to become a critical tool in the creation of a more efficient and less costly U.S. healthcare industry.

To optimize implementation and adoption of digital pathology systems within a large healthcare organization, initial assessment of both end user (pathologist) needs and organizational infrastructure are required. Contextual inquiry is a qualitative, user-centered tool for collecting, interpreting, and aggregating such detailed data about work practices that can be employed to help identify specific needs and requirements. AIM: Using contextual inquiry, the objective of this study was to identify the unique work practices and requirements in AP for the United States (US) Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) that had to be targeted in order to support their transition to digital pathology. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A pathology-centered observer team conducted 1.5 h interviews with a total of 24 AFMS pathologists and histology lab personnel at three large regional centers and one smaller peripheral AFMS pathology center using contextual inquiry guidelines. Findings were documented as notes and arranged into a hierarchal organization of common themes based on user-provided data, defined as an affinity diagram. These data were also organized into consolidated graphic models that characterized AFMS pathology work practices, structure, and requirements. RESULTS: Over 1,200 recorded notes were grouped into an affinity diagram composed of 27 third-level, 10 second-level, and five main-level (workflow and workload distribution, quality, communication, military culture, and technology) categories. When combined with workflow and cultural models, the findings revealed that AFMS pathologists had needs that were unique to their military setting, when compared to civilian pathologists. These unique needs included having to serve a globally distributed patient population, transient staff, but a uniform information technology (IT) structure. CONCLUSIONS: The contextual inquiry method helped reveal similarities and key differences with civilian pathologists. Such an analysis helped identify specific instances that would benefit from implementing digital pathology in a military environment.

Despite limited evidence for EHR-related cost savings, the 2009 HITECH Act included incentives for providers to become meaningful users of EHRs. We evaluated a large Massachusetts EHR pilot to obtain early insight into the potential for the national strategy to reduce short-run healthcare costs in the Medicaid population. METHODS: We calculated monthly ambulatory cost and visit measures from Medicaid claims data for beneficiaries receiving the majority of their care in the three Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative (MAeHC) pilot communities or in six matched control communities. Using a difference-in-differences of slope analysis, we assessed whether cost and visit trajectories differed in the pre-implementation period compared to the post-implementation period for intervention and control community members. RESULTS: We found evidence that EHR adoption impacted ambulatory medical cost in two of the three communities, but the effects were in opposite directions. Ambulatory medical costs increased more slowly in one intervention compared to its control communities in the pre-to-post period (difference-in-differences=-1.98%, p<0.001; PMPM savings of $41.60). In contrast, for a second pilot community, ambulatory medical cost increased more slowly in the control communities (difference-in-differences=2.56%, p=0.005; PMPM increase of $43.34).

The identified facilitators included: easiness of use and learning of the system complemented by EMRs upgrades, efficiency of EMRs in patient data management, responsive information technology (IT) and collegial support, and user training. The identified barriers included: frequent power blackouts, inadequate computers, retrospective data entry EMRs operation mode, lack of continuous training on system upgrades, and delayed IT support. CONCLUSIONS: Users generally believed that the EMRs improved the work process, with multiple factors identified as facilitators and barriers to their use. Most users perceived system functionalities and training as motivators to EMRs use, while infrastructural issues posed as the greatest barrier. No specific EMRs use facilitators and/or barriers could be attributed to facility performance levels. Continuous evaluations are necessary to assess improvements of the identified factors as well as determine emerging issues.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1186/s12911-021-01737-x,*Delivery of Health Care;*Electronic Health Records;Focus Groups;Humans;Kenya;Perception;Retrospective Studies,34955098,PMC8710176

To promote the use of health apps, we describe the lessons learned from developing 12 health apps in the largest tertiary hospital in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed 12 routinely used apps in three categories-Smart Clinic, Smart Patient, and Smart Hospital-based on target users and functions. The log data for each app were collected from the date of release up until December 2012. RESULTS: Medical personnel accessed a mobile electronic medical record app classified as Smart Clinic an average of 452 times per day. Smart Hospital apps are actively used to communicate with each other. Patients logged on to a mobile personal health record app categorized as Smart Patient an average of 222 times per day. As the mobile trend, the choice of supporting operating system (OS) is more difficult. By developing these apps, a monitoring system is needed for evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: We described the lessons learned regarding OS support, device choice, and developmental strategy. The OS can be chosen according to market share or hospital strategic plan. Smartphones were favored compared with tablets. Alliance with an information technology company can be the best way to develop apps. Health apps designed for smart devices can be used to improve healthcare.

Although this technology has the potential to improve the quality of patient care, its mere provision does not guarantee uptake: even where CDSSs are available, clinicians often fail to adopt their recommendations. This study examines the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of an evidence-based CDSS as perceived by diverse health professionals in hospitals at different stages of CDSS adoption. METHODS: Qualitative study conducted as part of a series of randomized controlled trials of CDSSs. The sample includes two hospitals using a CDSS and two hospitals that aim to adopt a CDSS in the future. We interviewed physicians, nurses, information technology staff, and members of the boards of directors (n = 30). We used a constant comparative approach to develop a framework for guiding implementation. RESULTS: We identified six clusters of experiences of, and attitudes towards CDSSs, which we label as ""positions."" The six positions represent a gradient of acquisition of control over CDSSs (from low to high) and are characterized by different types of barriers to CDSS uptake. The most severe barriers (prevalent in the first positions) include clinicians' perception that the CDSSs may reduce their professional autonomy or may be used against them in the event of medical-legal controversies. Moving towards the last positions, these barriers are substituted by technical and usability problems related to the technology interface. When all barriers are overcome, CDSSs are perceived as a working tool at the service of its users, integrating clinicians' reasoning and fostering organizational learning. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers and facilitators to the use of CDSSs are dynamic and may exist prior to their introduction in clinical contexts; providing a static list of obstacles and facilitators, irrespective of the specific implementation phase and context, may not be sufficient or useful to facilitate uptake. Factors such as clinicians' attitudes towards scientific evidences and guidelines, the quality of inter-disciplinary relationships, and an organizational ethos of transparency and accountability need to be considered when exploring the readiness of a hospital to adopt CDSSs.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1186/s13012-017-0644-2,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Health Plan Implementation/*methods;*Hospitals;Humans;Qualitative Research",28915822,PMC5602839

In addition, the amount of IT staff hired varies by level of EMR adoption, with the rate of IT FTE per bed started at a level of 0.082 FTE per bed at the lowest level of the EMR Adoption Model (Stage0) and increasing to 0.210 FTE bed at higher levels(Stage 4). We can extrapolate nationally to conclude that to move the entire US to higher levels of adoption (Stage 4) will require an additional 40,784 IT professionals. There are limitations to this analysis, including that the data are limited to IT professionals who are mainly in hospitals and do not include those who, for example, work for vendors or in non-clinical settings.

Unexpected downtime of health IT systems could therefore wreak havoc and result in catastrophic consequences. Little is known, however, regarding the nature of failures of health IT. OBJECTIVE: To analyze historical health IT outage incidents as a means to better understand health IT vulnerabilities and inform more effective prevention and emergency response strategies. METHODS: We studied news articles and incident reports publicly available on the internet describing health IT outage events that occurred in China. The data were qualitatively analyzed using a deductive grounded theory approach based on a synthesized IT risk model developed in the domain of information systems. RESULTS: A total of 116 distinct health IT incidents were identified. A majority of them (69.8%) occurred in the morning; over 50% caused disruptions to the patient registration and payment collection functions of the affected healthcare facilities. The outpatient practices in tertiary hospitals seem to be particularly vulnerable to IT failures. Software defects and overcapacity issues, followed by malfunctioning hardware, were among the principal causes. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected health IT downtime occurs more and more often with the widespread adoption of electronic systems in healthcare. Risk identification and risk assessments are essential steps to developing preventive measures. Equally important is institutionalization of contingency plans as our data show that not all failures of health IT can be predicted and thus effectively prevented.

STUDY DESIGN: Nationally representative, cross-sectional data on US office-based physicians from the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Physician Workflow Survey. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis of whether physicians routinely performed 14 specific care processes in 4 categories: population management, quality measurement, patient communication, and care coordination. Key independent measures were electronic health record (EHR) use and accountable care organization (ACO) or patient-centered medical home (PCMH) participation. RESULTS: A majority of physicians reported routinely conduct at least 1 care process related to care coordination (89%), patient communication (69%), and population management (67%); less than half reported performing at least 1 quality measurement process routinely (44%). EHR use and ACO or PCMH participation were independently associated with a higher likelihood of performing care processes.

Nation-wide implementation of integrated electronic health record (EHR) systems in hospitals was at the heart of the NPfIT (~$10billion). We conducted the first longitudinal, prospective, and sociotechnical case study implementation and adoption of national EHRs implementations in 12 'early adopter' hospitals across England. This paper reports the arrival, implementation process, and stakeholders' experiences of one EHR software (Millennium) at a National Health Service's (NHS) general hospital participating in NPfIT, hereafter called Alpha. From the outset, Alpha envisioned the implementation of EHR as a practice of change management to improve its performance. This vision attributed to the establishment of a 'design authority' at Alpha, including users from various capacities and levels. The 'design authority' was perceived a key contributor to appropriate (compared to other hospitals we studied) clinical engagement and bottom-up approach to deploying EHR. Through conducting several hundreds of group and individual workflow familiarization, Alpha adopted a novel approach to training staff on EHR software. This led to greater local configuration and high sense of ownership among users, which transformed work practices towards overall better performance of the hospital. Contrary to painful and turbulent experiences of EHR implementation via NPfIT route in the English hospitals, this in-depth case study revealed the importance of vision (change management) and insightful leadership in 'working out' EHR.

In France, the ""Hôpital numérique 2012-2017"" program was implemented as part of a strategic plan to modernize health information technology (HIT), including the promotion of widespread EHR use. With significant upfront investment costs as well as ongoing operational expenses, it is important to assess this system in terms of its ability to result in improvements in hospital performances. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of EHR use on the quality of care management in acute care hospitals throughout France. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on data derived from three national databases for the year 2011: IPAQSS (indicators of improvement in the quality and the management of healthcare, ""IPAQSS""), Hospi-Diag (French hospital performance indicators), and the national accreditation database. Several multivariate models were used to examine the association between the use of EHRs and specific EHR features with four quality indicators: the quality of patient record, the delay in sending information at hospital discharge, the pain status evaluation, and the nutritional status evaluation, while also adjusting for hospital characteristics. RESULTS: The models revealed a significant positive impact of EHR use on the four quality indicators. Additionally, they showed a differential impact according to the functionality of the element of the health record that was computerized. All four quality indicators were also impacted by the type of hospital, the geographical region, and the severity of the pathology.

The aim of this study was to explain the acceptance and actual use of an EPR and nurses' satisfaction by testing a theoretical model adapted from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in the medical-surgical wards of four hospitals ranked at different EPR adoption stages. A randomized stratified sampling approach was used to recruit 616 nurses. Structural equation modeling techniques were applied. RESULTS: Support was found for 13 of the model's 20 research hypotheses. The strongest effects are those between performance expectancy and actual use of the EPR (r=0.55, p=0.006), facilitating conditions and effort expectancy (r=0.45, p=0.009), compatibility and performance expectancy (r=0.39, p=0.002). The variables explained 33.6% of the variance of actual use, 54.9% of nurses' satisfaction, 50.2% of performance expectancy and 52.9% of effort expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Many results of this study support the conclusions of prior research, but some take exception, such as the non-significant relationship between the effort expectancy construct and actual use of the EPR. The results highlight the importance of the mediating effects of the effort expectancy and performance expectancy constructs.

Unfortunately, EHR data do not always directly and reliably map to medical concepts that clinical researchers need or use. Some recent studies have focused on EHR-derived phenotyping, which aims at mapping the EHR data to specific medical concepts; however, most of these approaches require labor intensive supervision from experienced clinical professionals. Furthermore, existing approaches are often disease-centric and specialized to the idiosyncrasies of the information technology and/or business practices of a single healthcare organization. In this paper, we propose Limestone, a nonnegative tensor factorization method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human supervision. Limestone represents the data source interactions naturally using tensors (a generalization of matrices). In particular, we investigate the interaction of diagnoses and medications among patients. The resulting tensor factors are reported as phenotype candidates that automatically reveal patient clusters on specific diagnoses and medications. Using the proposed method, multiple phenotypes can be identified simultaneously from data. We demonstrate the capability of Limestone on a cohort of 31,815 patient records from the Geisinger Health System. The dataset spans 7years of longitudinal patient records and was initially constructed for a heart failure onset prediction study. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness, stability, and the conciseness of Limestone-derived phenotypes. Our results show that using only 40 phenotypes, we can outperform the original 640 features (169 diagnosis categories and 471 medication types) to achieve an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.720 (95% CI 0.715 to 0.725).

The use of the tablet is becoming commonplace in healthcare organizations to improve patient care. The current study incorporates Technology Acceptance Model2 (TAM2) with two antecedents, facilitating condition and personal, to identify and understand the factors that influence nurses' intention to use the Tablet PC. The survey methodology was used to collect data from the nurses working in a regional healthcare center in Taiwan. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed to analyze the research framework. A total of 110 valid responses for analysis. The results suggest that the modified proposed research framework explains about 41.7% of the variance of nurses' behavioral intention. The partial least squares (PLS) regression indicated that perceived usefulness, subjective norm, and personal a positive and significant influence on nurses' intention to use the Tablet PC.

The World Health Organization has recommended the implementation of basic applications in healthcare systems to improve medication safety, but it is largely unknown whether these recommendations are adhered to by hospitals. We assessed the presence of core medication safety practices in Saudi Arabian hospitals. METHODS: We developed and validated a survey to assess medication safety practices in hospitals. Major headings included Look-Alike Sound-Alike (LASA) medications, control of concentrated electrolyte solutions, transitions in care, information technology, drug information and other medication safety practices. Trained pharmacists visited samples of hospitals from all regions of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Seventy-eight hospitals were surveyed. Only 30% of the hospitals had a medication safety committee and 9% of hospitals had a medication safety officer. Only 33% of hospitals had a list of LASA medications and 50% had a list of error-prone abbreviations. Concentrated electrolytes were available in floor stock in 60% of the hospitals. No hospital involved pharmacists in obtaining medication histories and only 37% of the hospitals provided a medication list to the patients at discharge. While 61% of hospitals used a computer system in their pharmacy to enter prescriptions, only 29% of these hospitals required entry of patient's allergies before entering a drug order. CONCLUSIONS: Core practices to improve medication safety were not implemented in many hospitals in Saudi Arabia.

CCDS in this setting aligns with policies to increase IT use in ambulance care, enhance paramedic decision-making skills, reduce avoidable emergency department attendances and improve quality of care and patient experience. This qualitative study was conducted alongside a cluster randomised trial in two ambulance services of the costs and effects of web-based CCDS system designed to support paramedic decision-making in the care of older people following a fall. Paramedics were trained to enter observations and history for relevant patients on a tablet, and the CCDS then generated a recommended course of action which could be logged. Our aim was to describe paramedics' experience of the CCDS intervention and to identify factors affecting its implementation and use. METHODS: We invited all paramedics who had been randomly allocated to the intervention arm of the trial to participate in interviews or focus groups. The study was underpinned by Strong Structuration Theory, a theoretical model for studying innovation based on the relationship between what people do and their context. We used the Framework approach to data analysis. RESULTS: Twenty out of 22 paramedics agreed to participate. We developed a model of paramedic experience of CCDS with three domains: context, adoption and use, and outcomes. Aspects of context which had an impact included organisational culture and perceived support for non-conveyance decisions. Experience of adoption and use of the CCDS varied between individual paramedics, with some using it with all eligible patients, some only with patients they thought were 'suitable' and some never using it. A range of outcomes were reported, some of which were different from the intended role of the technology in decision support. CONCLUSION: Implementation of new technology such as CCDS is not a one-off event, but an ongoing process, which requires support at the organisational level to be effective.

To overcome these barriers and bring FHH to the forefront of the personalized medicine effort, we developed the genomic medicine model (GMM) for primary care. The GMM, founded upon the principles of the Health Belief Model, Adult Learning Theory and the implementation sciences, shifts responsibility for FHH onto the patient, uses information technology (MeTree(©)) for risk stratification and interpretation, and provides education across multiple levels for each stakeholder, freeing up the clinical encounter for discussion around personalized preventive healthcare plans.

Pathology has lagged behind other healthcare practices such as radiology where digital adoption is widespread. As devices that generate whole slide images become more practical and affordable, practices will increasingly adopt this technology and eventually produce an explosion of data that will quickly eclipse the already vast quantities of radiology imaging data. These advances are accompanied by significant challenges for data management and storage, but they also introduce new opportunities to improve patient care by streamlining and standardizing diagnostic approaches and uncovering disease mechanisms. Computer-based image analysis is already available in commercial diagnostic systems, but further advances in image analysis algorithms are warranted in order to fully realize the benefits of digital pathology in medical discovery and patient care.

We applied the newly created PRO standards from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to facilitate the collection and integration of standardized PRO data. A novel multitiered architecture was created to enable seamless integration of PRO data via Substitutable Medical Apps and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources apps and scaled to different EHR platforms in multiple ambulatory settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a standards-based approach to deploy 2 apps that source and surface PRO data in real-time for provider use within the EHR and which rely on PRO assessments from an external center to streamline app and EHR integration. RESULTS: The apps were developed to enable patients to answer validated assessments (eg, a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System including using a Computer Adaptive Test format). Both apps were developed to populate the EHR in real time using the Health Level Seven FHIR standard allowing providers to view patients' data during the clinical encounter. The process of implementing this architecture with 2 different apps across 18 ambulatory care sites and 3 different EHR platforms is described.

METHODS: This study used survey data on adoption of EMR systems; data included that from various hospital organizational structures. The survey was conducted from April 10 to August 3, 2009. The response rate was 33.5% and the total number of small general hospitals was 144. Data were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation method to adjust for environmental clustering effects. RESULTS: The adoption rate of EMR systems was 40.2% for all responding small hospitals. The study results indicate that IT infrastructure (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.80) and organic hospital structure (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.23) rather than mechanistic hospital structure or the number of hospitals within a county (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.17) were critical factors for EMR adoption after controlling for various hospital covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that several managerial features of hospitals and one environmental factor were related to the adoption of EMR systems in small Korean hospitals.

EPS2 is information technology that allows community pharmacies to download and dispense electronically written prescriptions from general practices. When the prescriber writes a prescription electronically, it is sent and stored on a national central database, commonly called the Spine. The community pharmacy that the patient nominates is then able to download the prescription and dispense to the patient. METHOD: In-depth interviews were conducted with professionals from eight early adopter community pharmacies in the midlands and north of England, and 56 hours of non-participant observations were recorded as field notes. Each interview transcript was coded using a line-by-line approach. Overall, 37 200 words were analysed from 10 transcripts using a 'bottom up' approach to identify key perceptions. Field notes from the observation were analysed thematically and were used to verify interview findings. KEY FINDINGS: Findings follow a narrative which shows that (a) early adopter pharmacies had to cope with challenges such as missing EPS2 prescriptions, (b) despite this, they perceived EPS2 as helpful in streamlining pharmacy workflow and (c) were therefore keen to retain EPS2.

This study reviews historic patterns of information technology (IT) in healthcare, analyzes barriers and enabling factors, and draws three lessons. First, the widespread adoption of clinical IT, including CDS systems, depends on having the right organizational and individual financial incentives in place. Second, although CDS systems and clinical IT in general are powerful tools that can be used to support the practice of medicine, they alone cannot redefine the workflow or processes within the profession. Healthcare managers counting on technology to restructure or monitor clinicians' work patterns are likely to encounter substantial resistance to CDS systems, even those that generate valuable information. Third, while the pace of implementing IT systems in healthcare has lagged behind that of other industries, many of the obstacles are gradually diminishing.

In France, the ""Hôpital numérique 2012-2017"" program was implemented as part of a strategic plan to modernize health information technology (HIT), including promotion of widespread EHR use. With significant upfront investment costs as well as ongoing operational expenses, it is important to assess this system in terms of its ability to result in improvements in hospital performances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of EHR use on the organizational performances of acute care hospital surgical units throughout France. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on data derived from three national databases for year the 2012: IPAQSS (Indicators of improvement in the quality and the management of healthcare, ""IPAQSS""), Hospi-Diag (French hospital performance indicators), and the national accreditation database. National data and methodological support were provided by the French Ministry of Health (DGOS) and the French National Authority for Health (HAS). Multivariate linear models were used to assess four organizational performance indicators: the occupancy rate of surgical inpatient beds, operating room utilization, the activity per surgeon, and the activity per both nurse anesthetist and anesthesiologist which were dependent variables. Several independent variables were taken into account, including the degree of EHR use. RESULTS: The models revealed a significant positive impact of EHR use on operating room utilization and bed occupancy rates for surgical inpatient units. No significant association was found between the activity per surgeon or the activity per nurse anesthetist and anesthesiologist with EHR use. All four organizational performance indicators were impacted by the type of hospital, the geographical region, and the severity of the pathologies.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data from the HIMSS Analytics EMR Adoption Model (EMRAM(SM)) to measure the adoption and use of information technology in Dutch hospitals. To measure the quality and safety of healthcare in Dutch Hospitals we used select data from the publicly available basic set and the safety set of the Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) and the Dutch Health Care Transparency Program 'Zichtbare Zorg' (ZIZO) program. The quality and safety measures selected reflect the measures used to score Dutch hospitals as presented in Elsevier's annual 'The Best Hospitals' publication. The scores of this publication are based upon 542 of the 1516 available indicators from this basic set and safety set. Almost all indicators from the hospital-wide indicator sets are included in the selection, as are a large portion of indicators for acute care delivered by all hospitals. Of the 84 non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands, 67 (80 %) were included in this study.

That is the focus of ""The Crossroads of Telehealth, Electronic Health Records & Health Information Exchange: Planning for Rural Communities,"" a new white paper from the Northwest Regional Telehealth Resource Center (NRTRC). ""Accelerating adoption and utilization of telehealth technologies, telemedicine in particular, will be critical to a successful stakeholder response to the disruptive changes that are underway in healthcare,"" said NRTRC Executive Director Christina B. Thielst, FACHE. ""By leveraging telehealth networks and their existing infrastructures, Regional Extension Centers, HIEs and other data-sharing initiatives will be better-positioned to fulfill their commitments to the healthcare delivery system of the future--a system in which even the most rural and remote populations have timely access to care and their health records."" The white paper explores emerging trends and recent disruptors impacting the healthcare delivery system and examines the opportunities they present for the advancement of telecommunications-based health solutions and the broadband infrastructure available through telehealth networks. It also takes an in-depth look at the various uses of telehealth and the most common delivery models of telemedicine, as well as the role of the telehealth network and Telehealth Resource Centers (TRCs) in expanding the reach of these vital initiatives. Finally, the white paper highlights the evolution of the REACH Montana Telehealth Network from facilitating teleradiology at three remote sites into a consortium of healthcare providers at 18 sites linked by high-bandwidth telecommunications in the north central region of Montana. REACH, which considers HIE to be a primary function, is currently working to leverage its existing T1 infrastructure to create the ""railroad tracks"" that will carry medical data and information within the region and beyond. ""This white paper is an excellent analysis of the intersection of telehealth and health information technology, and the opportunities and challenges this electronic technology will bring to rural America,"" said Terry J. Hill, Executive Director of the Rural Health Resource Center, the Duluth, Minn.-based national knowledge center for rural hospitals providing technical assistance, information, education and other resources to rural health care providers and their communities. Adds Thielst: ""Crossroads is a valuable planning tool for any healthcare stakeholder, but it is especially important for rural communities wanting to address health information exchange. It is just one of many resources available through the NRTRC to help advance the involvement of teleheatlh networks in HIE initiatives and to help transform the telehealth infrastructure into the 'superhighway' across which remote and rural areas will finally be able to participate in the widespread exchange of electronic health information.""

The intervention was associated with improved CVD risk factor screening but there was no improvement in prescribing rates of guideline-recommended medicines. The aim of this study was to conduct a process evaluation to identify and explain the underlying mechanisms by which the intervention did and did not have an impact. METHODS/DESIGN: Normalisation process theory (NPT) was used to understand factors that supported or constrained normalisation of the intervention into routine practice. A case study design was used in which six of the 30 participating intervention sites were purposively sampled to obtain a mix of size, governance, structure and performance. Multiple data sources were drawn on including trial outcome data, surveys of job satisfaction and team climate (68 staff) and in-depth interviews (19 staff). Data were primarily analysed within cases and compared with quantitative findings in other trial intervention and usual care sites. RESULTS: We found a complex interaction between implementation processes and several contextual factors affecting uptake of the intervention. There was no clear association between team climate, job satisfaction and intervention outcomes. There were four spheres of influence that appeared to enhance or detract from normalisation of the intervention: organisational mission and history (e.g. strategic investment to promote a QI culture enhanced cognitive participation), leadership (e.g. ability to energise or demotivate others influenced coherence), team environment (e.g. synergistic activities of team members with different skill sets influenced collective action) and technical integrity of the intervention (e.g. tools that slowed computer systems limited reflective action). DISCUSSION: Use of NPT helped explain how certain contextual factors influence the work that is done by individuals and teams when implementing a novel intervention. Although these factors do not necessarily distil into a recipe for successful uptake, they may assist system planners, intervention developers, and health professionals to better understand the trajectory that primary health care services may take when developing and engaging with QI interventions.

To address this, our multidisciplinary team developed and implemented a pharmacist-led telehealth medication management program for veterans prescribed OATs by community providers. SUMMARY: The program exclusively uses telehealth to connect veterans with a dedicated board-certified clinical oncology pharmacist who provides comprehensive medication management. The program is based on established pharmacy models found in the research literature. We developed a standard operating procedure, communication templates, patient education materials, and a suite of health information technology tools to help streamline pharmacy processes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to design implementation strategies to promote the adoption of the program. In the first year, 64 veterans from 3 VA medical centers were enrolled in the program. The oncology clinical pharmacist performed 342 encounters and 101 interventions. The program saved an estimated $200,724 in medication-related costs. The veterans we surveyed reported high levels of satisfaction with the pharmacy services provided by the program. CONCLUSION: The delivery of comprehensive medication management through telehealth is feasible from a healthcare system perspective and beneficial for patients.

The mere provision of CDSSs, however, does not guarantee their uptake. Rather, individual and institutional perceptions can foster or inhibit the integration of CDSSs into routine clinical workflow. Current studies exploring health professionals' perceptions of CDSSs focus primarily on technical and usability issues, overlooking the social or cultural variables as well as broader administrative or organizational roles that may influence CDSS adoption. Moreover, there is a lack of data on the evolution of perceived barriers or facilitators to CDSS uptake across different stages of implementation.

Prior studies have identified factors correlated with EHR use, but less is known about characteristics of physicians on the verge of adoption. OBJECTIVE: To compare characteristics of physicians who are imminent adopters of EHRs with EHR users and non-users. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey was mailed (June - November 2005) to a stratified random sample of all medical practices in Massachusetts. One physician from each practice (n=1884) was randomly selected to participate. Overall, 1345 physicians (71.4%) responded to the survey, with 1082 eligible for analysis due to exclusion criteria. 'Imminent adopters' were those planning to adopt EHRs within 12 months. MEASUREMENTS: We assessed physician and practice characteristics, availability of technology, barriers to adoption or expansion of health information technology (HIT), computer proficiency, and financial considerations. RESULTS: Compared to non-users, imminent adopters were younger, more experienced with technology, and more often in practices engaged in quality improvement. More imminent adopters owned or partly owned their practices (57.4%) than users (33.5%; p<0.001), but fewer imminent adopters owned their practices than non-users (65.7%; p<0.001).

Considering the levels of IT investment and adoption in primary care medical practices, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors leading to greater performance outcomes from EMR systems in primary care. To address this issue, we developed and tested a research model centered on the concept of Extended EMR Use. METHODS: An online survey was conducted of 331 family physicians in Canadian private medical practices to empirically test seven research hypotheses using a component-based structural equation modeling approach. RESULTS: Five hypotheses were partially or fully supported by our data. Family physicians in our sample used 67% of the clinical and 41% of the communicational functionalities available in their EMR systems, compared to 90% of the administrative features. As expected, extended use was associated with significant improvements in perceived performance benefits. Interestingly, the benefits derived from system use were mainly tied to the clinical support provided by an EMR system. The extent to which physicians were using their EMR systems was influenced by two system design characteristics: functional coverage and ease of use. The more functionalities that are available in an EMR system and the easier they are to use, the greater the potential for exploration, assimilation and appropriation by family physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has contributed to the extant literature by proposing a new concept: Extended EMR Use. In terms of its practical implications, our study reveals that family physicians must use as many of the capabilities supported by their EMR system as possible, especially those which support clinical tasks, if they are to maximize its performance benefits. To ensure extended use of their software, vendors must develop EMR systems that satisfy two important design characteristics: functional coverage and system ease of use.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.1186/s12911-015-0152-8,"Adult;Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data;Family Practice/standards;Health Care Surveys;Health Services Research/*methods;Humans;Physicians, Family/*standards;Private Practice/*standards;Quebec",25888991,PMC4397686

While a growing field of evidence supports that nurses frequently play key roles in steering the healthcare industry to achieve such goals, adoption and diffusion of technology remain complex processes. The application of IT still makes many nurses uneasy, while a main question remains whether nursing staff are willing to use state-of-the-art IT in their routine work.

Because only the most graphically appealing, informative, and patient-centered Web sites will drive patients to your practice. Patients are demanding improved communication with their physician. A practice Web site is a start, but the adoption of a fully functional, interactive Web site with patient portal solutions will not only improve patient-to-provider relationships but will also give the patient access to your practice from anywhere, at any time of the day. Furthermore, these solutions can help practices increase efficiencies and revenue, while reducing operating costs.

OBJECTIVE: Errors voluntarily reported by the healthcare practitioners in our institution (Kanazawa University Hospital) were considered to assess the contributory factors by using the accumulated error database in the hospital information system. METHODS: Medical errors in our institution during the period from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2002, were counted using the error reporting system database and were classified. RESULTS: The number of errors reported during the investigation period was 1378, of which 78% were reported by nursing staff. Medication errors involving administration of injectable or oral drugs to inpatients, dispensing, and prescription accounted for about 50% of that number. Among dispensing errors, 53% were detected by patients or their families and 36% by nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The best method of error prevention is to learn from previous errors. For this purpose, the error reporting program is effective. In patient safety management, it is important to take into account the potential risks of future errors, as well as to capture information about errors that have already happened. For safety management, adoption of appropriate information technology (e.g., implementation of a prescription order entry system) is effective in reducing medication errors.

METHODS: The BRUINchain system requirements include scanning the drug package for a correctly formatted 2D barcode, flagging expired products, verifying the product with the manufacturer, and quarantining suspect and illegitimate products at the last mile: pharmacist to patient, the most complex area of the drug supply chain.The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested using real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States. RESULTS: In addition to communicating with the manufacturer directly for verification, BRUINchain also initiated suspect product notifications. During the study, a 100% success rate was observed for scanning, expiration detection, and counterfeit detection; and paperwork reduction from approximately 1 hour to less than a minute. CONCLUSIONS: By automatically interrogating the manufacturer's relational database with our blockchain-based system, our results indicate a projected DSCSA compliance cost of 17 cents per unit, and potentially much more depending on regulatory interpretation and speed of verification. We project that this cost could be reduced with manufacturers' adoption of a highly performant, fully automated end-to-end system based on digital ledger technology (DLT). During an examination of the interoperability of such a system, we elaborate on its capacity to enable verification in real time without keeping humans in the loop, the key feature driving lower compliance cost. With 4.2 billion prescriptions being dispensed each year in the United States, DLT would not only reduce the projected per-unit cost to 13 cents per unit (saving $183 million in annual labor costs), but also serve as a major bulwark against bad or fraudulent transactions, reduce the need for safety stock, and enhance the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect US consumers.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,10.30953/bhty.v3.134,"",36777051,PMC9907423

To track consumer perceptions of EHRs during this period, we conducted a national telephone survey annually for 3 consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013, corresponding with the early years of MU. STUDY DESIGN: Nationwide random digit-dial survey. METHODS: The survey used random digit-dial sampling on a dual frame of landline and cell phone numbers in the continental United States, but was not otherwise stratified by geographic region, race, or other variables. Because our primary goal was to identify relationships between variables and EHR attitudes, we constructed post hoc survey weights to align all 3 samples with each other. Relationships between sociodemographics and EHR questions were assessed with logistic regression models using the survey weights. Cross-year comparisons were conducted with χ2 tests and Cochran-Armitage tests for linear trend. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2013, the proportion of respondents with a doctor who used an EHR rose from 64% to 71%. In 2011, 64% endorsed the belief that EHRs would improve healthcare quality, dropping to 62% by 2013. Simultaneously, the proportion concerned about the effects of EHRs on privacy dropped from 48% to 41%. Consumers whose doctors used EHRs were generally more likely to believe EHRs would improve healthcare quality and less concerned about privacy risks than those whose doctors did not use EHRs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we conclude that during the early years of the MU program, exposure to EHRs increased while confidence in the benefits of EHRs and concerns about privacy risks became less marked. The subset of people exposed to EHRs via their physicians continued to have more positive attitudes toward them than those without that exposure.

METHODS: During the implementation of POC technology data about user acceptance were collected with the help of surveys and statistically analyzed. The survey also allowed for entering non-structured observations. A time series study was conducted to identify factors associated with technology change and its effect on professional competency. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare markets and consumers are demanding that providers use sophisticated information technology to document, transmit and access clinical and financial information across all delivery points. Newly adapted Patient Care Information Systems (PCIS) are available for clinical use in home care. The factors associated with home care nurses' end user acceptance and use of the POC technology in clinical work are described. A sociotechnical approach with selected change management strategies appears to have positively influenced the nurse end users' POC technology adoption and use in clinical work.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,,"Attitude of Health Personnel;*Attitude to Computers;Community Health Nursing/*organization & administration;Home Care Agencies/*organization & administration;Humans;*Medical Records Systems, Computerized;Nurses/psychology;Pilot Projects;*Point-of-Care Systems;United States",14534651,

METHODS: This paper will review the initial concepts of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and the early developments and standardization efforts that lead to the deployment of large intra-institutional networks of image distribution allowing radiologists and physicians to access and review images digitally. With the deployment of PACS came along the need for advanced tools for image visualization and image analysis. RESULTS: Review of the history of PACS and Imaging Informatics clearly shows that the early developments were focused on the radiologist's requirements for diagnosis and image interpretation. These early developments lagged behind the rapid adoption of digital imaging in areas outside radiology. Only recently, imaging informatics shifted toward the development of new tools geared toward the needs of other users such as surgeons, referring physicians and care-providers, and even for the patients themselves. Also in the recent years, the development of multimedia and communication tools in the consumer market has influenced the design and strategic development of image management platforms inside and outside healthcare institutions. CONCLUSIONS: The focus of imaging informatics has clearly shifted in the last decade from basic infrastructure design to complete data and image navigation systems. While the challenge of storing and managing large volumes of imaging data have slowly vanished with the rapid development if information technology, the new challenge emerged from the new requirements of image manipulation and analysis in clinical practice.",RAYYAN-LABELS: High Focus,,"Diagnostic Imaging/*history;History, 20th Century;History, 21st Century;Humans;Radiology Information Systems/*history/standards",19855892,

Such an investment is even more costly, however, if the technology does not appropriately enable organizations to perform business processes that help them accomplish their mission of providing safe, high-quality care cost-effectively. Before committing to a costly IT investment, healthcare organizations should implement a decision-making process that can help them choose, implement, and use technology that will provide sustained business value. A seven-step decision-making process that can help healthcare organizations achieve this result involves performing a gap analysis, assessing and aligning organizational goals, establishing distributed accountability, identifying linked organizational-change initiatives, determining measurement methods, establishing appropriate teams to ensure systems are integrated with multidisciplinary improvement methods, and developing a plan to accelerate adoption of the IT product.",RAYYAN-LABELS: Less Focus,,*Capital Expenditures;Delivery of Health Care/economics/*organization & administration;Guidelines as Topic;Information Systems/*economics;*Investments;United States,12013639,
